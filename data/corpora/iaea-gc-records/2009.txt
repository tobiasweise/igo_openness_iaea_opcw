22. Israeli nuclear capabilities 
(GC(53)/1/Add.1; GC(53)/19 and 26; GC(53)/L.1 and Add.1) 

1. The PRESIDENT said that item 22 had been included in the ConferenceÂs agenda pursuant to a request by the Arab States that were members of the Agency. An explanatory memorandum was attached to document GC(53)/1/Add.1. In that connection, the Conference also had before it documents GC(53)/19 and GC(53)/26. Documents GC(53)/L.1 and Add.1 contained a draft resolution submitted by a number of countries. 
2. Mr EL-KHOURY (Lebanon), speaking on behalf of the Arab States that were members of the Agency, said that all Arab States without exception had adopted a united stance in support of the non-proliferation regime, had acceded to the NPT and had approved the initiative aimed at establishing a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East. Israel was the only State that possessed nuclear weapons in one of the worldÂs most troubled regions, and the only country in the region that had refused to accede to the NPT and to place its nuclear facilities under Agency safeguards. Its attitude rendered peace and security difficult to achieve and was a source of increased tension in the Middle East that could trigger an arms race. 
3. The goal of the Arab States in raising the issue at successive sessions of the General Conference was not only to draw attention to the dangerous situation, but also to propose practical solutions. The only conceivable solution consisted in adopting a comprehensive approach that took the security of all countries in the Middle East into consideration, instead of dealing in a biased and selective manner with each country individually and applying double standards. Thanks to the efforts of the Arab States over the preceding three decades, resolutions had been adopted by the United Nations General Assembly and Security Council, and by the NPT Review Conferences, that called on Israel to accede to the NPT and to place all its nuclear facilities under comprehensive Agency safeguards as a prerequisite for the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East. 
4. Impartial reports had confirmed that Israel possessed a significant arsenal of nuclear weapons. The Arab States and the international community as a whole could not afford to ignore that situation, or tolerate IsraelÂs efforts to develop its nuclear capabilities in the face of the lack of any real international pressure to impede such an escalation. 
5. Some countries did their utmost to prevent the General Conference from adopting a resolution that mentioned Israel by name. At the same time, charges were levelled against other countries without solid proof. No solution could ever be found as long as that situation persisted. He would seek to address the arguments invoked by some States to block a vote on the draft resolution before the Conference. 
6. Such States claimed that the AgencyÂs role was a technical one and that it was inappropriate for it to address political issues. That was a claim that could be rebutted with irrefutable facts. The item had been discussed at numerous previous sessions of the Conference and far more strongly worded resolutions had been adopted. The text of the draft resolution submitted at the preceding session had been amended in the light of the views of a number of Member States and it focused on technical points that fell within the AgencyÂs mandate, namely accession to the NPT and application of comprehensive safeguards. 
7. The argument that a single resolution on the Middle East was sufficient did not hold water. The resolution on application of IAEA safeguards in the Middle East adopted at an earlier meeting fell under a different agenda item and constituted a basic and necessary step towards the achievement of the goal of the current resolution. Israel had chosen to isolate itself by insisting on remaining outside the framework of the NPT and the safeguards regime. Moreover, there was nothing in the Rules of Procedure of the General Conference to prevent it from adopting two resolutions dealing with the same region. 
8. The Arab States had reacted positively to the call for a compromise by some Member States. They had pinned great hopes on the new international climate that had begun to emerge early in 2009 and had inserted a new preambular paragraph (f) to reflect those hopes. He trusted that the Conference would act accordingly and sweep away the difficulties that had arisen in previous years. The international community should show understanding for the fears of the Arab States and accept their commitment to a just, comprehensive and lasting peace. 
9. The Arab States that were members of the Agency insisted on the inalienable right of every country Â a right enshrined in the basic instruments of all international organizations Â to express its concerns and to seek to resolve them with the support of the international community. They urged the General Conference to give the issue of Israeli nuclear capabilities the attention it deserved and to vote unanimously for the draft resolution with a view to ridding the Middle East of nuclear weapons and laying the basis for peace and security in the region and the world as a whole. 
10. Mr FAWZY (Egypt), speaking on behalf of NAM, said that NAM Heads of State and Government, at their 15th Summit held in Sharm El Sheikh in July 2009, had urged the continued consideration of the issue of Israeli nuclear capabilities within the framework of the IAEA, including at the 53rd session of the General Conference. The Vienna Chapter of NAM, in a letter to the Director General, had subsequently expressed its support for the inclusion of the item ÂIsraeli nuclear capabilitiesÂ in the agenda of the General Conference. 
11. In paragraph 123 of the final document of the 15th NAM Summit, NAM had stated its position on the issue in the following terms: 
ÂThe Heads of State and Government ... reaffirmed the need for the speedy establishment of a NWFZ in the Middle East in accordance with the Security Council Resolution 487 (1981) and paragraph 14 of the Security Council Resolution 687 (1991) and the relevant General Assembly resolutions adopted by consensus. ... [T]hey demanded on Israel, the only country in the region that has not joined the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) nor declared its intention to do so, to renounce possession of nuclear weapons, to accede to the NPT without delay, to place promptly all its nuclear facilities under IAEA full-scope safeguards according to Security Council Resolution 487 (1981) and to conduct its nuclear related activities in conformity with the non proliferation regime. ... They expressed great concern over the acquisition of nuclear capability by Israel which poses a serious and continuing threat to the security of neighbouring and other States, and condemned Israel for continuing to develop and stockpile nuclear arsenals. In this context they also condemned the statement made by the Prime Minister of Israel on 11 December 2006, related to the possession of nuclear weapons by Israel. They urged the continued consideration of the issue of Israeli nuclear capabilities in the context of the IAEA, including at the General Conference at its 53rd Session. They were of the view that stability cannot be achieved in a region where massive imbalances in military capabilities are maintained particularly through the possession of nuclear weapons, which allow one party to threaten its neighbours, and the region. ... They also called for the total and complete prohibition of the transfer of all nuclear-related equipment, information, material and facilities, resources or devices and the extension of assistance in the nuclear related scientific or technological fields to 
Israel. In this regard, they expressed their serious concern over the continuing development whereby Israeli scientists are provided access to the nuclear facilities of one NWS. This development will have potentially serious negative implications on security in the region as well as the reliability of the global non-proliferation regime.Â 

12. Mr CODORNIU PUJALS (Cuba) said that his country attached great importance to the sensitive item under discussion which had serious negative implications for regional and international peace and security. As IsraelÂs actions were in breach of the spirit of the AgencyÂs Statute, Cuba was unable to accept the argument that the subject matter of the draft resolution lay beyond the scope of the organizationÂs mandate. Israel should accede forthwith to the NPT and place its nuclear facilities under comprehensive Agency safeguards. The countries of the Middle East region had long been pressing for that with a view to establishing a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the region. 

13. In the interests of the countries of the Middle East, and in order to eliminate a source of global instability, it was essential to halt the transfer to Israel of all nuclear-related equipment, information, material, facilities, resources or devices, and the extension of assistance in nuclear-related scientific or technological fields. 

14. Genuine political will and the elimination of double standards were needed to turn the Middle East into a region of peace and security for all. Cuba rejected the double standards espoused by the United States and other countries which harassed some States in the region for their alleged non-compliance with safeguards while continuing to provide nuclear assistance to Israel, and which sought by all available means to prevent the adoption of a resolution calling on Israel to accede to the NPT. The United States and its allies should be consistent: they should abandon their permissive approach to Israel and require it to destroy, under international control, the nuclear weapons that it seemed prepared to use, if necessary, to execute its plans in the Middle East. 

15. His country felt that IsraelÂs attitude should be addressed in a strongly word United Nations Security Council resolution. It firmly supported the resolution before the Conference, which it had decided to sponsor. 

16. Mr FAWZY (Egypt) said that Egypt had long ago undertaken to play a prominent role in promoting international peace, security and stability, not only in the Middle East but also in other geographical areas with which it had shared interests. The Middle East was an area of great strategic importance, and the goal of international and regional security could only be achieved if all parties enjoyed equal levels of security based on minimum stocks of weapons. Egypt had therefore focused in recent decades on regional and international disarmament and non-proliferation and, since 1974, on the establishment through the United Nations of a zone free of weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East, since the existence of such weapons, especially nuclear weapons, would thwart all attempts to achieve a comprehensive, fair and lasting peace in the region. In 1990, it had launched a specific initiative with that end in view. 

17. In recent years, Egypt had also made several proposals for steps to be taken by all States in the region to achieve practical progress towards the establishment of a zone free of weapons of mass destruction, such as the launching of regional negotiations, the announcement by States in the region of their intention to accede within a specific time limit to international instruments pertaining to non-proliferation or prohibition of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons, and the adoption of confidence-building measures in the nuclear field with a view to applying Agency safeguards to all nuclear facilities in the region and restricting and controlling fissile material produced by countries in the region. 

18. His country had hoped to promote a constructive dialogue in order to break the existing deadlock and allow all States in the region without exception to take practical steps to facilitate 
negotiations on the elimination of weapons of mass destruction, as well as to promote a new vision of the future that would consolidate security and remove doubts concerning nuclear activities in the region in order to prevent an arms race. Unfortunately, however, it had failed to set in motion a serious dialogue based on the right of all States and peoples of the region to peace and security. 
19. The Agency was still unable to apply comprehensive safeguards to all facilities in the Middle East for a single reason: IsraelÂs refusal to accede to the NPT and place its facilities under Agency safeguards. IsraelÂs logic was simple but wrong-headed, since it argued that a precondition for any practical step towards establishing a nuclear-weapon-free zone should be the achievement of a comprehensive peace in the region. The obvious question was how such a peace could be comprehensive and lasting in the absence of a nuclear-weapon-free zone. 

20. Unfortunately some parties were still willing to accept IsraelÂs twisted logic, overlooking the fact that lasting stability and security called for immediate national and regional disarmament measures. The result was continued stalling and procrastination. Not a single step had been taken to implement United Nations Security Council 487 (1981). The tendency instead was to resort to force, or to threaten use of force in the false belief that there were no alternative means of achieving security. 

21. It was to be hoped that the current international climate would provide a genuine opportunity to take far-reaching measures aimed at the elimination of weapons of mass destruction. 

22. Mr HASTOWO (Indonesia) said that IsraelÂs nuclear capabilities posed a serious and continuing threat to its neighbours and other States. The leaders of NAM, at their summit held in Sharm El Sheikh in July 2009, had stated that stability could be not be achieved in a region where massive imbalances in military capabilities were maintained, particularly through the possession of nuclear weapons, which allowed one party to threaten its neighbours and the region. 

23. The statement made by the Prime Minister of Israel in December 2006 concerning IsraelÂs possession of nuclear weapons was a source of great concern to the international community. The NAM Summit had therefore called for the complete prohibition of the transfer of all nuclear-related equipment, information, material and facilities, resources or devices, and the extension of assistance in nuclear-related scientific and technological fields to Israel. All countries should support that call to ensure the reliability of the NPT regime. 

24. Indonesia reiterated its support for the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East. It was deeply concerned at the lack of progress towards that goal because of IsraelÂs policy of refusing to place its installations under Agency safeguards or accede to the NPT, which were prerequisites for the establishment of such a zone and for the promotion of mutual confidence and security in the Middle East. His country therefore continued to support the consideration of the issue of Israeli nuclear capabilities at the General Conference. 

25. Mr SOLTANIEH (Islamic Republic of Iran) said that his country, as a victim of chemical weapons, had repeatedly called for effective measures to promote universal adherence to and full compliance with treaties concerning weapons of mass destruction. IsraelÂs nuclear weapons capabilities were not only a potential threat to global peace and security but also undermined the integrity, credibility and universality of the NPT. It was profoundly regrettable that a nuclear-weapon-free zone had not yet been established in the Middle East because of IsraelÂs defiance of all relevant resolutions and international norms and treaties. 

26. The current debate was taking place on Al-Quds Day, when millions of people all over the world were demonstrating against the atrocities committed by the Zionist regime, expressing sympathy with millions of homeless Palestinians who were victims of the occupation and disproportionate military bombardment using prohibited weapons, including phosphorus and depleted 
uranium, resulting in the massacre of thousands of innocent women and children, especially in Gaza. A United Nations fact-finding mission had that week described such action in Gaza as war crimes. 
27. It was a matter of great concern that continued international calls for immediate accession by Israel to the NPT, the destruction of its nuclear weapons and the placement of its nuclear facilities under Agency safeguards had produced nothing but deadlock. Although a former Prime Minister of the Israeli regime had admitted to the possession of nuclear weapons, its representatives at the Agency denied the official announcement whenever that regime was condemned by the Board of Governors or the General Conference. His delegation had requested the Director General to send a fact-finding mission to establish who was telling the truth. Given the AgencyÂs zero growth budget policy, his Government was prepared to bear the cost of such an inspection for the sake of international peace. 

28. Mr QUEISI (Jordan) said that the safeguards regime played a key role in preventing the proliferation of nuclear weapons and ensuring that nuclear energy was used solely for peaceful purposes and for the benefit of all peoples. 

29. Nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction posed a major threat to international peace and security and, in particular, to stability in the Middle East, which continued to suffer the consequences of the failure to implement resolutions concerning nuclear disarmament. It was imperative for Israel to accede to the NPT and place all its nuclear installations under Agency safeguards in order to achieve universality of the NPT in the region and lay the basis for the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone. The countries of the region could then focus on economic and social development instead of devoting resources to an arms race. He urged the General Conference to engage in a serious and objective discussion of the agenda item and the draft resolution. 

30. Mr ELMESALLATI (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya) said that his country was deeply concerned about IsraelÂs possession of weapons of mass destruction, as admitted by a high-level Israeli official to a German news outlet. Libya condemned the application of double standards by some countries to the States of the Middle East region. Such a policy could only lead to greater extremism and violence in a region whose peoples could no longer tolerate policies of hegemony and condescension, or the ongoing disregard for countriesÂ legitimate fears for their security. 

31. Many resolutions had been adopted by international organizations, and at the 1995 and 2000 NPT Review Conferences, calling on Israel to accede to the NPT and place its nuclear facilities under Agency safeguards. Unfortunately, none of them had been implemented owing to IsraelÂs intransigence and failure to comply with any such resolutions. Libya therefore strongly urged all Member States to bring pressure to bear on Israel to accede to the NPT, and to allow the General Conference to adopt the draft resolution before it in order to send a clear signal to Israel that the international community was determined to enforce universality of the NPT and to promote peace and security in the Middle East. 

32. Ms GONZÂLEZ (Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela) expressed concern at the Israeli GovernmentÂs repeated refusal to accede to the NPT and place its nuclear installations under Agency safeguards, a refusal that constituted an obstacle to the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East. Israel continued to ignore the appeals of the international community in various resolutions adopted by the AgencyÂs General Conference and the United Nations General Assembly, and in Security Council resolution 487 (1981). Her countryÂs concern had increased considerably when representatives of the Israeli Government had admitted publicly that the country possessed nuclear weapons. 

33. The world could not remain indifferent to the fact that a State which had ignored United Nations resolutions for decades had an advanced nuclear programme that was not subject to any Agency safeguards. The same State had repeatedly challenged the international community by using force 
against neighbouring countries at the cost of thousands of innocent lives and flouting basic principles of international humanitarian law, as had been noted by high-level United Nations authorities. 
34. The draft resolution before the General Conference called on Israel to accede to the NPT and to place all its nuclear facilities under Agency safeguards, a call that was becoming increasingly urgent in view of IsraelÂs repeated threats to peace in the Middle East. It should finally be acknowledged that IsraelÂs failure to adhere to the NPT constituted a blatant challenge to the international community and raised the question of whether the Israeli Government was genuinely interested in achieving peace with its neighbours. 

35. Mr HASSAN ALHAMADI (Qatar) said that the situation in the Middle East was unstable and unbalanced because of IsraelÂs possession of major nuclear capabilities, and because of its refusal to accede to the NPT and place its facilities under comprehensive Agency safeguards. 

36. The international community was duty bound to address the existing imbalance. The draft resolution submitted by the Arab States was a contribution to international efforts to send a message to the only State in the Middle East with nuclear capabilities, which posed a threat to peace, security and stability, that it should abandon its dangerous policy. Qatar called on all Member States to vote in favour of the draft resolution and not to obstruct any measures taken to implement it. 

37. Mr WOOD (Canada) recalled that, for the past several years, the General Conference had expressed a clear unwillingness to take action on a divisive resolution focusing on a specific country. Canada regretted that the same situation, which served no useful purpose, had now recurred. 

38. Although the General Conference already had an agenda item on the application of IAEA safeguards in the Middle East, and despite the fact that many countries had serious concerns about an item entitled ÂIsraeli nuclear capabilitiesÂ, in a spirit of understanding Canada and other concerned countries had not challenged the inclusion of the latter item in the agenda. Many had hoped that that gesture of goodwill would lead to a more consensual approach and Canada had supported the personal efforts of the President and the efforts of the United States of America and the European Union to reach a mutually satisfactory outcome. 

39. Despite the positive outcome on the preceding day on the resolution on the application of IAEA safeguards in the Middle East, the draft resolution on Israeli nuclear capabilities remained imbalanced and inappropriate. Canada therefore felt that it had no choice but to move for adjournment of the debate under Rule 59 of the Rules of Procedure. In making that proposal, it appealed to the sponsors of the agenda item to work with all members of the Agency to restore the consensus-based approach that all wished to prevail at the General Conference. 

40. Ms FEROUKHI (Algeria), on a point of order, asked for an explanation of the adjournment in terms of timescale. 

41. The PRESIDENT explained that, if the motion was carried, no further action would be taken by the Conference on the resolution at the current session. 

42. Mr EL-KHOURY (Lebanon) said that the Arab States strongly objected to the motion and called for an immediate vote on the draft resolution. 

43. The PRESIDENT said that, in accordance with the legal advice she had received, and pursuant to Rule 62 of the Rules of Procedure on the order of procedural motions, the Conference must continue with the adjournment motion under Rule 59. 

44. Mr RAUTENBACH (Director, Office of Legal Affairs), following a further request for clarification from Ms FEROUKHI (Algeria), said that practice and precedent at the General 
Conference dictated that, if the motion proposed by the representative of Canada was carried, then the current session of the Conference would take no further action on the item. 
45. Mr WOOD (Canada) requested that the motion be immediately put to the vote. 
46. Mr RAUTENBACH (Director, Office of Legal Affairs), in response to comments made by Ms FEROUKHI (Algeria), Mr SOLTANIEH (Islamic Republic of Iran) and Mr WOOD (Canada), said that the inclusion of the item in the agenda for the next session of the General Conference would depend on the appropriate decision being taken by that session of the General Conference. 
47. Ms FEROUKHI (Algeria) asked for clarification regarding Rule 60 of the Rules of Procedures on the closure of debate. 
48. Mr RAUTENBACH (Director, Office of Legal Affairs) said that, under Rule 62, the motion put forward by Canada to adjourn the debate under Rule 59 must take precedence over any motion to close the debate under Rule 60, which latter action would entail stopping the debate and taking a vote on the resolution. 
49. The PRESIDENT called for two speakers in favour of and two against the motion proposed by Canada. 
50. Mr LUNDBORG (Sweden), speaking on behalf of the European Union and in favour of the motion, stressed that, in supporting the motion, his intention was not to block discussion of the implementation of IAEA safeguards in the Middle East or of the creation of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in that region. The European Union, together with other partners, had made sincere efforts to encourage and support dialogue with the States concerned. A good outcome had been achieved the preceding day on the resolution on the application of IAEA safeguards in the Middle East. The European Union did not believe that there was a need for another resolution on an issue that had already been fully discussed. Moreover, the European Union did not believe that the singling out of one country contributed positively to the atmosphere at the General Conference, as it had pointed out in the letter of 27 August 2009 from the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Sweden, on behalf of all Foreign Ministers of the European Union, to Mr Amre Moussa, Secretary General of the League of Arab States. Finally, the European Union deeply regretted that all efforts made with a view to agreeing on a Presidential statement on the item had not proved successful. 
51. Mr DAVIES (United States of America), speaking in favour of the motion, said that his country stood with the large majority that strongly supported the relentless pursuit of effective multilateral diplomacy within the General Conference. 
52. Together with its European Union, Egyptian, Israeli and other partners, the United States had demonstrated the preceding day, by the positive outcome on the resolution put forward by Egypt on the application of IAEA safeguards in the Middle East, that the General Conference did not need to continue to be held captive by the rancour of recent years on issues related to the Middle East region. The goal was to return to consensus and all had worked tirelessly to that end. 
53. The United States had taken no action to block the agenda item on Israeli nuclear capabilities, even though the item did not differ substantially from that on safeguards in the Middle East. The efforts to find an agreed outcome on the draft resolution on Israeli nuclear capabilities had failed because of the desire of some to use it to criticize a single country. Such an approach was highly politicized and failed to take account of the complexities involved in crucial nuclear-related issues in the Middle East. The preceding dayÂs resolution already called upon all States in the region to accede to the NPT. The United States therefore saw no point in proceeding with the current resolution as it was redundant. 
54. Some had claimed that curtailing discussion put democracy at peril. Democracy was not, however, about seeking confrontation; rather, it was about compromise, dialogue and cooperation in a spirit of mutual respect. To avoid needless confrontation, and in the interest of the new approach the United States was seeking to foster in the General Conference and Â more broadly Â in the international system, he therefore strongly advocated support for the motion put forward by Canada. 
55. Mr QUEISI (Jordan), speaking against the motion, said that thorough discussion was needed, especially by the General Conference, if efforts to create a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East and universalize the NPT were to be successful. Therefore, Jordan could not agree to adjournment of discussion of the item. 
56. Mr OTHMAN (Syrian Arab Republic), also speaking against the motion, expressed concern at the attempt to adjourn discussion of the item. Israeli nuclear capabilities were outside international control and thus posed a danger to peace and stability in the region and the world. 
57. Israel, with the help of some members of the Security Council, had been able to develop a nuclear arsenal covertly. At the same time, Israel had rejected numerous resolutions adopted in various forums, the latest being General Assembly resolution A/RES/63/84 of 13 January 2009 on the risk of nuclear proliferation in the Middle East. That resolution called upon Israel to accede to the NPT and noted that it was the only State in the Middle East that had still not done so. 
58. It was incumbent upon the General Conference to deal with IsraelÂs refusal to adhere to the NPT and submit its installations to Agency safeguards, and with the fact that it was against the convening of a Middle East forum as a first step towards the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East, from which it was clear that Israel did not care about international opinion. The international community must take a firm line and adopt practical steps regarding Israel, which committed all kinds of acts of violence in the region in breach of international law. The international community, and in particular States party to the NPT, must shoulder their responsibilities with respect to regional and global peace and security. 
59. The draft resolution on Israeli nuclear capabilities was a clear reflection of Arab concern that Israel was not a member of the NPT. The motion for adjournment of the debate was a reflection of the lack of concern of the international community about the Arab position. 
60. The PRESIDENT, as requested by Mr DAVIES (United States of America) and Mr EL-KHOURY (Lebanon) under Rule 72 of the Rules of Procedure, invited the General Conference to proceed to a roll-call vote on the motion to adjourn the debate under Rule 59 of the Rules of Procedure put forward by the representative of Canada. 
61. Congo, having been drawn by lot by the President, was called upon to vote first. 
62. The result of the vote was a follows: 
In favour: 	Albania, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Canada, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Georgia, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Republic of Korea, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Monaco, Montenegro, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Republic of Moldova, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Ukraine, United Kingdom, United States of America. 
Against: 	Algeria, Angola, Argentina, Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Belarus, Brazil, Burkina Faso, Chile, China, Cuba, Ecuador, Egypt, Ethiopia, Gabon, 
Ghana, Indonesia, Islamic Republic of Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, Malaysia, Mali, Morocco, Myanmar, Namibia, Niger, Nigeria, Oman, Pakistan, Peru, Philippines, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, Serbia, Singapore, South Africa, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Syrian Arab Republic, Tajikistan, Thailand, Tunisia, United Arab Emirates, Uruguay, Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, Vietnam, Yemen, Zimbabwe. 
Abstaining: 	Armenia, Cameroon, Chad, Colombia, India, Kenya, Malawi, Mexico, Mongolia, Panama, Russian Federation, Turkey, Uganda, United Republic of Tanzania, Zambia. 

63. There were 45 votes in favour and 53 against, with 15 abstentions. The motion was defeated. 

64. Mr EL-KHOURY (Lebanon) said that he felt that the rejection of the motion to adjourn the debate and take no action under the current item was a positive decision. It restored the right perspective and removed an obstacle to a deeper understanding of the issue. He thanked the countries that had rejected the motion. Their votes constituted a clear declaration of opposition to double standards and to selectivity in the work of the Conference. On behalf of all the Arab Member States, he expressed particular thanks to the member States of NAM, the African Group and the Organisation of the Islamic Conference. 

65. He then requested a vote on the draft resolution as a whole. 

66. Mr LUNDBORG (Sweden) requested a suspension of the meeting to allow European Union member States to consult. 

67. Mr EL-KHOURY (Lebanon), supported by Mr FAWZY (Egypt), opposed the request of the representative of Sweden for a pause in proceedings and called again for an immediate vote on the draft resolution. 

68. Mr CURIA (Argentina) said that, under Rule 61 of the Rules of Procedure, where a request for a suspension was opposed, there should be a vote on whether or not to suspend the meeting. 

69. The PRESIDENT, responding to a question raised by Mr OTHMAN (Syrian Arab Republic), said that the process of voting on the draft resolution had not yet begun. The motion to suspend the meeting must therefore be dealt with first. Thus, she invited the Conference to proceed to vote by show of hands on the motion to suspend the meeting. 

70. There were 49 votes in favour and 49 against, with 3 abstentions. The motion to suspend the meeting was defeated. 

71. The PRESIDENT then invited the Conference to proceed to vote on the draft resolution contained in document GC(53)/L.1. 

72. Mr DANIELI (Israel), explaining his delegationÂs vote against the draft resolution in advance, said that the draft resolution represented the height of hypocrisy and double standards on the part of the sponsors. The vote on the draft resolution followed the preceding dayÂs joint effort by Egypt and Israel, sponsored by the United States of America, the European Union and many other delegations, to create a better atmosphere while addressing, under item 21, the Middle East issues that had been imposed time and again on the proceedings of the General Conference by the Arab Group. Israel had expected to work on the current draft resolution in the same spirit of cooperation, but its sponsors had chosen to adopt an uncompromising attitude. 

73. In IsraelÂs view, the draft resolution was driven by the kind of short-sighted political aims that had never benefited the sponsor countries. The resolution undermined confidence among States in the 
Middle East rather than enhancing it. The States behind the resolution were openly hostile to Israel and missed no opportunity to stir up animosity and block conciliatory trends between Israel and Arab States. The resolution focused entirely on one country that had neither violated its obligations under any treaty or international instrument, nor threatened any of its neighbours. Israel had repeatedly stated that it would not be the first to introduce nuclear weapons into the Middle East. To single out Israel was counter-productive to regional confidence building and peace, and would also have negative implications for the credibility of the General Conference. 
74. IsraelÂs vision and policy was to establish the Middle East as a mutually verifiable zone free of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery. It had always emphasized that such a process should begin with confidence-building measures, which should be followed by mutual recognition, reconciliation and peaceful relations, as a consequence of which conventional and non-conventional arms control measures would emerge. IsraelÂs long-term goals for regional security and arms control had been approved by its Government. 

75. As the international community had accepted and recognized in other regions, the establishment of a zone free of weapons of mass destruction was an initiative that could only emanate from within the region itself. In IsraelÂs view, progress could not be made towards realizing the vision of such a zone without a fundamental change in regional circumstances, including a significant transformation of the hostile attitude of some States in the region towards Israel. The constant efforts by States in the region to single out Israel in blatantly anti-Israeli resolutions at the General Conference were a clear reflection of that hostile attitude. 

76. In recent years, the international community had witnessed several alarming proliferation developments in the Middle East. None of them had involved Israel, but all of them had challenged it and had posed a great threat to its security. Those developments had involved clear violations of non-proliferation obligations and had demonstrated the attitude of the States concerned to their international nuclear commitments. Several of the countries sponsoring the draft resolution in question had a proven record of non-compliance with their international legally binding nuclear obligations, and some were currently under Agency investigation with the aim of to obtaining a full explanation of their suspicious or undeclared nuclear activities. Rather than address their own issues, those countries preferred to divert the attention of the General Conference, and the international community as a whole, by creating a diplomatic smokescreen to obscure the real facts and findings with regard to their own violations. 

77. Grave and covert violations by Iran and Syria had been detected and formally reported by the Agency, and investigations in those countries had been hampered by a continued lack of cooperation, by denial of access and by efforts to mislead inspectors. Israel believed that Iran, Syria and some other States in the region had been using their membership of the NPT to disguise their pursuit of nuclear weapons, and that their flagrant violations should not go unpunished. 

78. The politically motivated draft resolution which singled out Israel had no place at the General Conference. Like many other Member States, Israel considered the politicization of the Agency to be inherently detrimental to its objectives, professional reputation and credibility. He called upon all delegations to vote against the draft resolution, thereby demonstrating their objection to such negative practices at the General Conference. 

79. Mr LUNDBORG (Sweden), explaining the votes of European Union member States and certain associated States in advance, said that the European Union appreciated the commitment of the Arab League to making the Middle East a zone free of weapons of mass destruction but did not believe that the draft resolution, which focused on a single country, would command consensus at the General Conference. The European Union had supported resolutions at previous General Conferences calling 
for all States in the region to accept comprehensive safeguards, which it believed to be a more balanced approach. The European Union reaffirmed its support for a zone free of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery in the Middle East and called on all States in the region to accept comprehensive safeguards. It stressed that the adherence of all States in the region to the NPT and CTBT was of great importance for the nuclear non-proliferation regime. He also drew attention to the European UnionÂs statement at the NPT Review Conference Preparatory Committee meeting in May 2009 on regional issues and implementation of the Middle East resolution of 1995. 
80. The PRESIDENT, responding to a query raised by Ms FEROUKHI (Algeria), pointed out that, under Rule 74 of the Rules of Procedure, explanations of vote could be given either before or after the voting process. 

81. Mr EL-KHOURY (Lebanon) requested a roll-call vote. 

82. Belarus, having been drawn by lot by the President, was called upon to vote first. 

83. The result of the vote was as follows: 

In favour: 	Algeria, Angola, Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Belarus, Burkina Faso, China, Cuba, Ecuador, Egypt, Ethiopia, Ghana, Indonesia, Islamic Republic of Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, Malaysia, Mali, Mongolia, Morocco, Myanmar, Namibia, Niger, Oman, Pakistan, Philippines, Qatar, Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, Serbia, Singapore, South Africa, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Syrian Arab Republic, Tajikistan, Thailand, Tunisia, United Arab Emirates, Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, Vietnam, Yemen, Zimbabwe. 
Against: 	Albania, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Canada, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Georgia, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Republic of Korea, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Monaco, Montenegro, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Republic of Moldova, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Ukraine, United Kingdom, United States of America. 
Abstaining: 	Argentina, Brazil, Cameroon, Chad, Chile, Colombia, Holy See, India, Kenya, Mexico, Nigeria, Peru, Uganda, United Republic of Tanzania, Uruguay, Zambia. 

84. There were 49 votes in favour and 45 against, with 16 abstentions. The resolution was adopted. 
85. Monsignor BANACH (Holy See), explaining his delegationÂs vote, said that the Holy See had always favoured the building of a climate of trust and peace in the Middle East region and had always supported every initiative aimed at resolving outstanding problems in the region. Thus, it had supported the resolution the preceding day under item 21. Furthermore, the Holy See hoped that the international community would continue to create conditions that favoured peace, avoiding tensions and the threat of war. 
86. In order to arrive at a sustainable solution, it was necessary to adopt a universal perspective on the problems that characterized the Middle East, including the nuclear question, and not to focus on single issues. It was important to be aware of the suffering of all peoples and to take account of their equal dignity, aspirations and legitimate interests. 
87. Mr KUMAR (India), explaining his delegationÂs vote, said that his country had had to abstain as it believed that the resolution incorporated elements extraneous to the Agency. 
88. Mr SOLTANIEH (Islamic Republic of Iran), explaining his delegationÂs vote, said that his country had voted in favour of the resolution because it deplored the attitudes and conduct of Israel, which jeopardized the AgencyÂs spirit of cooperation and polarized Member States. The division of States into northern and southern groups, as seen in the voting on the resolution, reflected a dangerous trend for the future of the Agency. Iran believed that most of the politically motivated debates among Member States over the preceding 40 years had related to the issue of IsraelÂs violations of international treaties and Agency resolutions, and its non-compliance with international obligations including the AgencyÂs Statute. He recalled that the AgencyÂs General Conference, in 1981, had approved resolution GC(XXV)/RES/381 declaring Israel in violation of the Statute. With reference to the statement by Israel that it had not violated any treaties, he noted that that came as no surprise, since Israel was not party to such treaties as the NPT. His country saw such statements as following a consistent line of hypocrisy and deception. Iran appealed to all Member States, from both North and South, to cooperate with one another and not to sacrifice that spirit of cooperation over the issue of Israel. 
89. Mr EL-KHOURY (Lebanon), on behalf of the Arab States, thanked all Member States that had voted in favour of the resolution. He expressed the hope that the resolution just adopted would be built upon in the future and that the spirit of Vienna would become a reality rather than just an empty phrase. In the light of the decision which had just been taken, and the one taken on the preceding day under item 21, the current session of the General Conference could be judged a true success. 
90. Mr DANIELI (Israel) said that his country deplored the resolution just adopted, which served no purpose of the Agency or its General Conference. Israel would not cooperate in any way with the resolution, which only aimed at reinforcing political hostilities and lines of division in the Middle East. The resolutionÂs sponsors would see no benefit from it besides the momentary satisfaction of the delegates present at the meeting. Israel would continue to cooperate with the delegations that had already demonstrated their desire to transform the General ConferenceÂs approach to Middle East issues.

24. 	Prohibition of armed attack or threat of attack against nuclear installations, during operation or under construction 
(GC(53)/1/Add.2 and GC(53)/20) 

1. The PRESIDENT noted that the item had been included in the agenda pursuant to a request by the Islamic Republic of Iran, whose explanatory memorandum was contained in the Attachment to document GC(53)/1/Add.2. The Attachment to document GC(53)/20 contained a communication from the Resident Representative of Egypt on behalf of the Vienna Chapter of NAM supporting the inclusion of the item in question. 

2. Mr SOLTANIEH (Islamic Republic of Iran) said that sustainable development and nuclear energy applications were highly dependent on the safe and secure management of nuclear energy. Accidents or events such as military attacks against nuclear facilities had a serious impact on the publicÂs perceptions of, and thus its support for, the further development of the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. 

3. The Chernobyl accident had demonstrated that radioactive material was not bound by international boundaries. Any release of radioactive material had serious radiological consequences whether it resulted from an accident or from a deliberate act of terrorism or a military attack. 

4. Since its founding, the Agency had dealt with both nuclear accidents and military attacks against nuclear installations. In the former case, an intensive and detailed technical analysis had been carried out involving leading experts from all over the world. In the latter case, however, the political environment had prevented action leading to the creation of a legally binding instrument as an international preventive measure. 

5. General Conference resolution GC(XXIX)/RES/444 stated that Âany armed attack on and threat against nuclear facilities devoted to peaceful purposes constitutes a violation of the principles of the United Nations Charter, international law and the Statute of the AgencyÂ. In resolution GC(XXXI)/RES/475, the General Conference had stated that it was ÂAware of the fact that an armed attack on a nuclear installation could result in radioactive releases with grave consequences within and beyond the boundaries of the State which has been attackedÂ. Finally, resolution GC(XXXIV)/RES/533 of 1990, proposed by Iran, had recognized that Âan armed attack or a threat of armed attack on a safeguarded nuclear facility, in operation or under construction, would create a situation in which the United Nations Security Council would have to act immediately in accordance with the provisions of the United Nations CharterÂ. 

6. In view of the extensive development and expansion of nuclear applications throughout the world since the adoption of the latest resolution on the issue in question almost two decades previously, there was an urgent need to renew the call for collective measures to prevent any military attack or threat of attack against nuclear facilities in operation or under construction. The international communityÂs minimum expectation of the Agency, as the competent organization in that field, was that it adopt a resolution based on its past decisions and new developments. 

7. The Agency had already recognized the importance of the safety, security and physical protection of nuclear material and nuclear facilities. 

8. In view of the aforementioned facts, and bearing in mind the bitter reality of the potential threat to the health and safety of the people of the world, his country proposed that the General Conference 
should: a) Deplore any threat of attack or attack against any nuclear installation and enact appropriate collective punitive measures vis-Ã -vis possible violators, in accordance with the Statute of the Agency and the United Nations Charter; b) Request the Director General to study the feasibility of starting negotiations, under the auspices of the Agency, with a view to concluding a legally binding international instrument to prevent the attack or threat of attack against nuclear installations; c) Request the Director General to explore the possibility of using the texts of two post-Chernobyl conventions, the Convention on Early Notification of a Nuclear Accident and the Convention on Assistance in the Case of a Nuclear Accident or Radiological Emergency, as a model for early notification and mutual assistance in case of an armed attack against nuclear facilities and, in that context, request the Director General to establish an emergency assistance mechanism at the AgencyÂs Headquarters in Vienna similar to that which exists for nuclear accidents, to render technical assistance to Member States that have been attacked, upon request, inter alia radiation protection assistance; d) Encourage all Member States to render, upon request, immediate technical and humanitarian assistance to any Member States whose nuclear installations have been subjected to an armed attack; and e) Request the Director General to include the item under discussion in the agenda for the 54th regular session of the General Conference and to report on steps implemented with respect to issues of concern and interest touched upon during the current session, and on any further developments. 
9. Iran had decided not to table a resolution, though it had received the support of members of NAM and other countries. Since the issue was one of concern to almost all Member States, it was important that any decision be adopted unanimously. 

10. Mr FAWZY (Egypt), speaking on behalf of the Vienna Chapter of NAM, recalled that, in a letter to the Director General dated 24 August 2009, the Vienna Chapter of NAM had lent its support to the inclusion of an item in the agenda for the current session of the General Conference entitled ÂProhibition of armed attack or threat of attack against nuclear installations, during operation or under constructionÂ, as it considered the item to be relevant to the work of the Agency. 

11. As a reflection of the importance they attributed to the issue, NAM Heads of State and Government had included the following language in paragraph 137 of the final document issued by the 15th NAM Summit held in Sharm el Sheikh in July 2009: 

ÂThe Heads of State and Government reaffirmed the inviolability of peaceful nuclear activities and that any attack or threat of attack against peaceful nuclear facilities Â operational or under construction Â poses a great danger to human beings and the environment and constitutes a grave violation of international law, principles and purposes of the UN Charter and regulations of the IAEA. They recognised the need for a comprehensive multilaterally negotiated instrument prohibiting attacks or threat of attacks on nuclear facilities devoted to peaceful uses of nuclear energy.Â 

12. Mr CODORNIU PUJALS (Cuba) said that his country considered the General ConferenceÂs examination of the issue in question both timely and relevant. 
13. As was recognized in Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter, force was a means of last resort to be used only in extraordinary circumstances to maintain international peace and security. The abuse and illegitimate use of force, and the threat of its use, not only violated Article 2.4 of Chapter I of the Charter, it put the possibility of a just and definitive solution to any conflict out of reach forever. 
14. Furthermore, an armed attack on a nuclear facility could result in radioactive releases with grave consequences for the health of human beings and for the environment extending beyond national borders. 
15. Despite wide recognition of those facts, in recent years the world had witnessed frequent threats by certain States to use force against facilities, and even an instance where one such State had brazenly bombed a location in another country based on ÂsuspicionsÂ that it was a nuclear facility. 
16. Cuba firmly rejected such attitudes and held the view that the international community should mobilize immediately to prohibit them. Thus, his country supported the view voiced by NAM that a multilateral instrument was needed to prohibit attacks or threats of attack on nuclear facilities. 
17. The Agency, as the organization responsible for promoting the peaceful and safe use of nuclear energy, should take the initiative in promoting the negotiation of such an instrument. 
18. Mr OTHMAN (Syrian Arab Republic) said that it was a source of great concern that the Conference was unable to agree on a resolution prohibiting armed attack or threat of attack on nuclear installations during its current session. In 1981, Israel had destroyed a nuclear reactor in Iraq and it was still threatening to bombard nuclear facilities in Iran. Those facilities were under Agency safeguards and international inspectors were verifying all activities that were being conducted in them. 
19. Syria had expected that the Conference would consider any attack or threat of attack against peaceful nuclear activities a crime deserving of punishment. The inability of the Conference to take such a decision placed a great responsibility on the shoulders of Member States with respect to the need to establish international peace and security. 
20. On the preceding day, the representative of Israel had commented on violations of commitments by neighbouring countries, which his delegation had been surprised to hear. Israel had circulated unfounded accusations against Syria and had tried to upset the work of the Agency. It was the only country in that region which violated such commitments and which violated international legal decisions regarding non-proliferation. It was also the only country that had openly admitted that it possessed nuclear weapons, thereby threatening the security and stability of the whole region. 
21. Syria hoped that the issue under discussion would be given the importance it deserved at the next session of the General Conference, that it would be included as an item on the agenda of the 54th General Conference and that agreement would be reached on a resolution. 
22. He reminded those present that the aim of establishing a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East was not merely to add one more such zone to those already existing in the world; rather, it was a serious attempt to remove one threat which had rendered that region unstable. The establishment of such a zone was the only means of ensuring peace and security for the whole world. 
23. The PRESIDENT invited the Conference to endorse the following Presidential statement which reflected the agreed compromise on the item: 
24. ÂThe General Conference considered the agenda item 24 entitled ÂProhibition of armed attack or threat of attack against nuclear installations, during operation or under constructionÂ. The General Conference noted GC(XXIX)/RES/444 and GC(XXXIV)/RES/533, which noted that Âany armed attack on and threat against nuclear facilities devoted to peaceful purposes constitutes a violation of the principles of the United Nations Charter, international law and the Statute of the AgencyÂ, and a thorough discussion was made on all aspects of the issue. Member States recognized the importance attached to safety, security and physical protection of nuclear material and nuclear facilities and, in that regard, expressed their views on the importance they attached to the protection of nuclear installations. They also noted the need to have the Agency involved in early notification and assistance in cases of radioactive release from nuclear installations.Â 
25. The Conference endorsed the Presidential statement. 
26. Ms FEROUKHI (Algeria) said that it was perhaps useful that the Conference had reflected on the issue, and that the item had been placed on the agenda, since the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material and the International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism, both of which had been ratified by Algeria, did not address those kinds of attacks. 
20. 	Implementation of the NPT safeguards agreement between the Agency and the Democratic PeopleÂs Republic of Korea (GC(53)/13; GC(53)/L.4 and 7) 

27. The PRESIDENT, turning to agenda item 20, which had been included in the agenda pursuant to General Conference resolution GC(52)/RES/14, said that, since that resolution had been adopted, the Director General had reported periodically to the Board on the implementation of safeguards in the DPRK and, in document GC(53)/13, he summarized the developments over the preceding year. Document GC(53)/L.4 contained a draft resolution submitted by a number of sponsors. Document GC(53)/L.7 contained a proposal by other Member States for the insertion of a new operative paragraph in that draft resolution. The latter two documents had been submitted only that day. However, since that was the last day of the Conference, she took it that there was no objection to suspending of Rule 63 of the Rules of Procedure of the General Conference in order to enable the Plenary to consider the draft resolution and the proposed amendment. 

28. 	It was so decided. 

29. Mr KUMAR (India), raising a point of order, said that his delegation had just had the opportunity to see the proposed amendment contained in document GC(53)/L.7 and was surprised that it appeared to have nothing to do with the substance of the resolution but sought to bring in a much larger issue on which it would be difficult for his delegation to take a position without consulting with its national authorities. As such, he cautioned against taking up that proposal. 

30. Mr EL-KHOURY (Lebanon) said that the Arab Group perceived that the draft resolution contained in document GC(53)/L.4 could not achieve its objective without universal application of the NPT. He saw no reason why anyone should vote against universal application of the NPT but, in the interests of reducing conflict during the General Conference, he withdrew the proposal for a new operative paragraph on behalf of the Arab Group. 

31. Mr BARRETT (Canada), introducing the draft resolution contained in document GC(53)/L.4, said it had been negotiated by a core group of countries in consultation with China and Russia. The resolution was being submitted on behalf of approximately 40 Member States, and he apologized for its late circulation. It reiterated concerns about actions by the DPRK that posed serious challenges to the nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament regime, as well as to peace and security. It urged the DPRK not to conduct any further nuclear tests and stressed the importance of full implementation of obligations pursuant to United Nations Security Council resolutions. It deplored the DPRKÂs cessation of all cooperation with the Agency, endorsed the actions taken by the Board of Governors and commended the impartial efforts of the Director General and the Secretariat to apply comprehensive safeguards in the DPRK. It stressed the desire for a diplomatic resolution of the DPRK nuclear issue, with the aim of achieving the complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. It also expressed support for the six-party talks process and called on the DPRK to return immediately and without preconditions to that process. Finally, it called on the DPRK to come into full compliance with the NPT and to cooperate promptly with the Agency in the full and effective 
implementation of comprehensive safeguards. The draft resolution was supported by the five Member States which were party to the six-party talks and Canada hoped that it would be adopted by consensus. 
32. Mr CODORNIU PUJALS (Cuba) pointed out that, on the preceding day, opposition had been voiced to examining a resolution on the grounds that the Conference should not single out one country. However, no such opposition had been voiced in the current instance. His country deplored such double standards. 
33. Although his country understood that the issue was a complicated and delicate one, it would have liked to discuss the proposed amendment to the draft resolution, with the aim of underscoring the need to work more vigorously toward the total elimination of nuclear weapons. It reaffirmed its conviction that only the total elimination of nuclear weapons and nuclear tests could genuinely contribute to guaranteeing international peace and security. 
34. Cuba supported the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and firmly believed that diplomacy and peaceful dialogue should continue with a view to achieving a long-term solution to the Korean nuclear issue. 
35. It thereby reaffirmed its position on nuclear disarmament and underlined its concern at the threat to humanity posed by the continued existence of nuclear weapons and their possible use or threat of use. His country continued to be deeply concerned that the States which possessed such weapons were not making progress toward disarmament and the total elimination of their nuclear weapons. 
36. He appealed to the nuclear-weapon States to fulfil immediately their obligations under Article VI of the NPT and to accelerate implementation of the measures agreed upon at the 1995 and 2000 NPT Review Conferences in that regard, in particular the 13 practical steps agreed upon at the 2000 NPT Review Conference. 
37. Cuba would have liked to see the amendment adopted because it would have made the resolution more balanced. However, it did not wish to break the consensus. 
38. Mr DANIELI (Israel) said that his country supported the draft resolution contained in document GC(53)/L.4. 
39. The DPRKÂs reckless conduct called for the strongest possible condemnation and action by the international community. Its non-compliance with its safeguards agreement, its decision to cease all cooperation with the Agency, its continued defiance of United Nations Security Council resolutions, and its second nuclear test earlier in 2009 were deplorable and posed a grave threat to international security and to the non-proliferation regime. 
40. Such activities also had dangerous implications for the Middle East region, where the DPRK was a major proliferator and supplier of ballistic missiles to rogue countries. For example, the DPRKÂs assistance to SyriaÂs covert nuclear programme was still awaiting full investigation by the Agency. Its recent nuclear test and missile tests highlighted the importance of determined, concerted action by the international community. That would also send the right message to habitual violators in the Middle East concerning their international commitments and obligations in the nuclear domain. 
41. Mr OTHMAN (Syrian Arab Republic) said it was indeed surprising that a State which was not a member of the NPT and which had no safeguards agreement should lecture others on how they should conduct their international relations. Such statements should be made by countries that complied with international conventions. 
42. The PRESIDENT took it that the Conference wished to adopt the draft resolution contained in document GC(53)/L.4 without a vote. 
43. It was so decided. 
44. Mr SHIM Yoon-Joe (Republic of Korea) said that, since the preceding General Conference, international efforts to bring about the verifiable denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula had faced a series of challenges caused by provocative actions on the part of the DPRK. The DPRK had violated the six-party talks agreements and relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions not only through its nuclear test in May, but also through the launch of a long-range rocket in April and ballistic missiles in July. Furthermore, it had sent a letter earlier that month to the President of the Security Council in which it had defiantly asserted that it would continue developing its nuclear capabilities. Such actions were a blatant challenge to the international community. 
45. The adoption of Security Council Resolution 1874 (2009), which had condemned the DPRKÂs nuclear test in the strongest terms and had reinforced the sanctions regime already in place against that country, had clearly demonstrated the united and resolute will of the Security Council and the international community to halt the DPRKÂs nuclear development and nuclear proliferation activities. His country believed that all nations should send an unequivocal message to the DPRK by fully implementing the obligations imposed by that resolution. 
46. The resolution just adopted by consensus was another firm message from the international community to the DPRK. His country expected that the resolution would contribute to the DPRKÂs realization that its nuclear ambitions would not be tolerated by the international community. It was imperative that the DPRK promptly return to the six-party talks, that it abandon all nuclear weapons and existing nuclear programmes in a complete, verifiable and irreversible manner in accordance with the September 2005 Joint Statement, and that it return to the NPT regime and comply with its international obligations and all its commitments. 
47. The Agency had an essential role to play in that process and his country would cooperate closely with relevant countries and the Agency with a view to achieving a peaceful resolution of the DPRK nuclear issue and establishing peace and stability in north-east Asia.

Strengthening the effectiveness and improving the efficiency of the safeguards system and application of the Model Additional Protocol (agenda item 19) 

26. Mr KUMAR (India) said that, as a founder member of the Agency, his country had consistently supported the organizationÂs activities conducted within the framework of its Statute. India attached great importance to the AgencyÂs safeguards activities, in particular, and had contributed to strengthening the effectiveness and improving the efficiency of the safeguards system, including through its active participation in the Advisory Committee on Safeguards and Verification within the Framework of the IAEA Statute and in the informal working group on the future of the Agency. 

27. His country had hoped that the draft resolution on the agenda item in question could be adopted by consensus and he found it regrettable that his countryÂs suggestion to remove a basic inconsistency in operative paragraph 3 of the text had not been followed in the version before the General Conference. Until 2000, there had consistently been consensus on the General Conference resolutions on safeguards. However, in 2001 that consensus had been broken when a new operative paragraph had been added urging all Member States to bring into force comprehensive safeguards agreements. Regrettably, that paragraph, which was untenable as it overlooked other types of safeguards agreements, had continued to appear in successive draft resolutions on safeguards. Noting that the signing of safeguards agreements was a sovereign decision by States, he said that India had no option but to request a vote on operative paragraph 3 of the draft resolution contained in document GC(53)/COM.5/L.2/Rev.1. 

28. The PRESIDENT invited the Conference to vote on operative paragraph 3 of the draft resolution by show of hands. 

29. There were 90 votes in favour and 2 against, with 2 abstentions. The paragraph was adopted. 

30. Mr EL-KHOURY (Lebanon), speaking on behalf of the Arab Group, requested a roll-call vote on the draft resolution as a whole. 

31. Nicaragua, having been drawn by lot by the President, was called upon to vote first. 

32. The result of the vote was as follows: 

In favour: 	Albania, Angola, Argentina, Australia, Austria, Azerbaijan, Bangladesh, Belgium, Brazil, Bulgaria, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Canada, Chile, China, Croatia, Cuba, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Ecuador, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Ghana, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Indonesia, Islamic Republic of Iran, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Kazakhstan, Republic of Korea, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malaysia, Malta, Mexico, Mongolia, 
Montenegro, Myanmar, Namibia, Netherlands, New Zealand, Niger, Nigeria, Norway, Panama, Peru, Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Republic of Moldova, Romania, Russian Federation, Serbia, Singapore, Slovakia, Slovenia, South Africa, Spain, Sri Lanka, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Turkey, Ukraine, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom, United States of America, Uruguay, Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, Zambia, Zimbabwe. 
Abstaining: 	Algeria, Bahrain, Egypt, India, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, Morocco, Nicaragua, Oman, Pakistan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Syrian Arab Republic, Tunisia, Yemen. 

33. There were 80 votes in favour and none against, with 18 abstentions. The draft resolution was adopted. 

34. Mr ANWAR (Pakistan), speaking in explanation of vote, said that Pakistan supported all activities of the Agency in every area of the organizationÂs responsibility, in accordance with the provisions of the Statute. Its support for Agency safeguards manifested itself in the fulfilment of all its safeguards obligations and in its cooperation with the Agency in that regard. The commitment of Pakistan to Agency safeguards was anchored in its firm belief that the role of safeguards was to facilitate cooperation in the peaceful use of nuclear energy without discrimination based on political or strategic considerations. 

35. His delegation had been constrained to vote against operative paragraph 3 of the draft resolution owing to the failure of the sponsors to make that paragraph consistent with the letter and spirit of the Statute. The latter took into account the differentiated nature of the safeguards obligations of Member States and did not prescribe a particular safeguards model as the only standard for Agency verification. It was thus more generous and inclusive. In calling for the universalization of a particular safeguards model, adherence to which was not a legal obligation of all Member States, the draft resolution contradicted the Statute. 

36. His delegationÂs vote was a reflection of PakistanÂs commitment to upholding the AgencyÂs Statute in every respect. Pakistan would continue to support the AgencyÂs verification activities in a manner consistent with the framework laid down in the Statute. 

37. Mr SOLTANIEH (Islamic Republic of Iran), speaking in explanation of vote, said that his delegation had voted in favour of the resolution as it showed some improvements compared with the resolution adopted the preceding year. He had also wished to demonstrate his countryÂs support for the safeguards regime, provided that it did not jeopardize the national security of any country. However, his delegation had had reservations about certain paragraphs, and some suggestions to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the safeguards system which had not been reflected in the final draft. He expressed the hope that his countryÂs constructive suggestions would be taken into consideration before the next session of the General Conference with a view to producing a more balanced text the following year. 

38. Mr EL-KHOURY (Lebanon), speaking on behalf of the Arab Group, said that the Member States of the Arab Group which had abstained in the roll-call vote had done so not because they did not support the AgencyÂs safeguards system, but because they called for the universalization of the NPT and the AgencyÂs safeguards regime, which should apply to all States without exception. The Arab States in question were all party to the NPT and had concluded comprehensive safeguards agreements with the Agency, and they all complied fully with their legal obligations. Their commitment to the AgencyÂs work was also amply demonstrated by their support for previous General 

Conference resolutions on Israeli nuclear capabilities and for the establishment of a nuclear-weaponÂ­free zone in the Middle East. 
28. 	Report on contributions pledged to the Technical Cooperation Fund for 2010 
39. The PRESIDENT said that document GC(53)/23/Rev.4 contained details of the pledges of contributions to the Technical Cooperation Fund for 2010 which Governments had made to the Director General by 8 p.m. on 17 September 2009. By that time, Member States had pledged a total of $9 008 135, or 10.60% of the target for 2010. That figure was 37% lower than the percentage of pledges received by the corresponding time in the preceding year. Since that document had been sent for printing, further Member States had communicated pledges to the Director General, as follows: Cameroon Â $7650; Chile Â $131 750; China Â $2 183 650; Democratic Republic of the Congo Â $2550; Luxembourg Â $69 700; Monaco Â $2550; United Arab Emirates Â $247 350. That brought the total amount pledged to $11 653 335, or 13.71% of the 2010 Technical Cooperation Fund target. She urged all delegations which had not yet done so to make their 2010 pledges and to pay their contributions in full at the earliest opportunity so that the Secretariat could submit to the Technical Assistance and Cooperation Committee in November a proposed 2010 technical cooperation programme based on the level of pledges received, and thereafter implement the approved programme without hindrance or uncertainty. 
Â 	Closing of the session 

40. The PRESIDENT said that the current session of the General Conference had been well attended by high-level representatives of Member States, including two Vice-Presidents, two Deputy Prime Ministers, 25 Ministers, two Ministers of State and one First Lady. During the general debate, 110 speakers had taken the floor. 
41. She paid tribute to the professionalism, competence, impartiality and vision of the outgoing Director General, Dr ElBaradei, who had expanded the AgencyÂs unique role in enhancing the contribution of nuclear energy to the peace and welfare of humanity, and under whose leadership the Agency had been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. She also congratulated Dr ElBaradeiÂs successor, Mr Amano, a seasoned diplomat with outstanding professional experience, who would take up his post on 1 December 2009, and she wished him a very successful tenure. Finally, she paid tribute to Mr Papadimitropoulos of the Greek delegation who was attending his 50th General Conference. 
42. Mr GHISI (Italy) paid tribute to the professionalism and diplomacy with which the President had conducted the work of the General Conference. Her meticulous preparations had begun well before the session. She had brought a rare feminine touch to the proceedings, showing patience, serenity and understanding, and a smiling determination to reconcile conflicting views. 
43. The PRESIDENT expressed her gratitude for the kind words addressed to her on behalf of the Conference. It had been an honour and privilege for her and her country to be elected to serve as President of the General Conference during its 53rd session. 
44. She thanked all delegates for their cooperation, which had allowed the problems encountered during the conduct of business to be dealt with. 
45. On behalf of the Conference, she thanked the Director General and his staff for the valuable support they had provided during the session, the Austrian authorities which had provided the permanent conference facilities which the General Conference had used that year for the first time, and the city of Vienna for its hospitality during the past week. 
46. She expressed her good wishes on the occasion of the Jewish New Year festival of Rosh Hashanah and the Muslim festival of Eid al-Fitr. 
47. Finally, in accordance with Rule 48 of the Rules of Procedure of the General Conference, she invited the Conference to observe one minute of silence dedicated to prayer or meditation. 
All present rose and stood in silence for one minute. 
48. The PRESIDENT declared the fifty-third regular session of the General Conference closed.

Â Opening of the session 

1. The TEMPORARY PRESIDENT declared open the 53rd regular session of the General Conference. 

2. In accordance with Rule 48 of the Rules of Procedure of the General Conference, he invited delegates to observe one minute of silence dedicated to prayer or meditation. 

All present rose and stood in silence for one minute. 

3. The TEMPORARY PRESIDENT said that the current General Conference would be the last during the mandate of Mr ElBaradei. He paid tribute to the exceptional integrity, professional skills and vision with which Mr ElBaradei had led the Agency. The Agency had had many achievements over the last twelve dramatic years, but perhaps the one that best symbolized them all was the Nobel Peace Prize of 2005. Wishing Mr ElBaradei success and happiness, he expressed the hope that as Director General Emeritus he would continue to give the Agency the benefit of his vast experience. 

4. He extended his warm congratulations to Ambassador Yukiya Amano for his designation as the new Director General and wished him every success for his appointment during the General Conference and his forthcoming tenure of office. 

5. For him personally, the 2008 General Conference had had its share of frustrating, satisfying and hopeful moments. Frustrating because, in the end, his time had been almost completely absorbed by only one of the many important issues on the agenda; satisfying, because the General Conference had reached constructive conclusions in the full spectrum of its activities, while on the more sensitive and controversial issues a whole range of opinions had been voiced and exchanged; hopeful, given the great importance which Member States attached above and beyond existing divergent political views to the fulfilment of all aspects of the AgencyÂs mandate. 

6. The global challenges which humanity was facing made the AgencyÂs mission of ÂAtoms for PeaceÂ more vital than ever. Security and development, both covered in the AgencyÂs mandate, were two sides of the same coin, namely, peace. The AgencyÂs role in both areas was crucial and would be even more so in the future, particularly as concerned non-proliferation and nuclear disarmament. A world free of nuclear weapons Â a longstanding dream of humanity Â was on the agenda, and it was to be hoped that the NPT Review Conference could be an important step forward in reinforcing and universalizing the non-proliferation regime. In view of the NPTÂs enhanced role, the best contribution which the General Conference could make now would be to conduct fruitful deliberations to achieve continuing progress on the AgencyÂs ÂAtoms for PeaceÂ mission within its existing mandate. 

7. Equally, the AgencyÂs role in development was of growing importance; the most recent global crises (food, fuel, finance) had made the international communityÂs efforts to attain the United Nations Millennium Development Goals even more difficult. To make progress to that end in the near future, due attention must be given to reviewing the AgencyÂs activities and providing sufficient support to enhancing them in the two areas related to development in its mandate: nuclear applications and nuclear power. Nuclear applications were extremely useful for improving food security and quality, health and the environment. Technical assistance to Member States wishing to develop nuclear power in a safe, secure and peaceful manner was a crucial contribution to alleviating the world energy crisis. 

8. He therefore welcomed the AgencyÂs decision to devote the 2009 Scientific Forum to energy for development and particularly commended the initiative of focusing on energy as the Âmissing 
development goalÂ. He had stressed the same point at the Vienna Energy Conference, organized jointly by UNIDO and the Austrian Government in June 2009. Indeed the combined effects of the food, fuel and finance crises compounded the risks of climate change which, if not properly addressed, would create ever greater obstacles to sustainable development, particularly in the poorest countries. Vienna, hosting several international agencies and organizations dealing with energy, such as the IAEA, UNIDO, OPEC and IIASA, was becoming an increasingly significant forum for coordinating efforts towards a new global energy agenda for the international community. 
9. In addressing the General Conference in 2008, he had expressed the hope that the efforts of the Director General and many others towards convening a forum on a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East could produce results by the end of 2009. Unfortunately that had not been the case, despite there being a consensus on the idea. Goodwill had not been enough to overcome the differences between the parties more directly involved on how to organize such a forum. He hoped that in the debate that followed on Middle East issues, notwithstanding differing views and positions, emphasis could be placed on points held in common. If that new, more constructive approach prevailed, it would at long last be possible to fulfil the hopes expressed at the 44th General Conference. 

10. Over the past year, he had seen promising signs of re-engagement and a spirit of compromise, for instance in the lively and constructive debate on the future of the Agency or in connection with reaching a compromise on budget issues. He urged the General Conference to renew the spirit of Vienna, mindful of the political value of the technical debate in the Agency and the potential impact which fulfilment of the AgencyÂs mandate could have on peace and development. With that reinvigorated spirit, he was convinced that the General Conference would achieve excellent results. 

1. 	Election of officers and appointment of the General Committee 

11. The TEMPORARY PRESIDENT invited nominations for the office of President of the Conference. 

12. Mr POTTS (Australia), speaking on behalf of the South East Asia and the Pacific Group, proposed Ms MacMillan (New Zealand). 

13. 	Ms MacMillan (New Zealand) was elected President by acclamation. 

14. The TEMPORARY PRESIDENT congratulated Ms MacMillan on her election and wished her every success in her task. 

Ms MacMillan (New Zealand) took the Chair. 

15. The PRESIDENT, thanking the South East Asia and the Pacific Group for nominating her, and all Member States for electing her to that challenging position, said she counted on them all to approach their joint task constructively and in the spirit of Vienna. 

16. The General Conference was a unique event on the AgencyÂs annual calendar. It brought together all Member States to discuss every aspect of the AgencyÂs work Â safety and security, science and technology, and safeguards and verification. Although there was a healthy debate on the prioritization of the AgencyÂs activities, Member States were unified in their commitment to its objectives, namely to accelerate and enlarge the contribution of atomic energy to peace, health and 
prosperity throughout the world and to ensure, so far as it was able, that assistance provided by it, or at its request, or under its supervision or control, was not used in such a way as to further any military purpose. That commitment needed to be kept in view during the forthcoming discussions both in plenary and in the Committee of the Whole. The resolutions on which attention would be focused were a way of ensuring the continuation of the important technical work of the Agency in all of its fields of activity and in all regions of the world. 
17. The challenges facing the Agency were diverse: they were old and new, financial and technical, and increasingly complex. As recognised in the AgencyÂs Statute and reflected in its ever-growing membership, nuclear technology offered tremendous benefits in the fields of human health, water quality, crop enhancement, pest control and energy for development. Developing and sharing those benefits would be critical for addressing poverty, hunger and disease for millions of people as the international community worked to achieve the United Nations Millennium Development Goals. 

18. While pursuing its important work in those areas, the Agency must also fulfil its obligations in addressing the complex and broad-ranging safety and security challenges posed by nuclear technology. Providing the Agency with the means to fulfil its safety, security and verification mandates was essential to ensure that the awesome power of atomic energy was used solely for peaceful purposes throughout the world. 

19. Those issues were intimidating, but the Agency did not deal with them alone. Rather, it was a vital component of the nuclear non-proliferation architecture. After a lacklustre period, it appeared that the disarmament and non-proliferation landscape might be on the verge of positive change, with growing support for a world free from nuclear weapons and the recognition that nuclear disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation were mutually reinforcing principles. The Agency could contribute to and benefit from that encouraging change, and she looked forward to sending a united and positive message from the 53rd session of the General Conference. 

20. In addition, the General Conference would highlight the value of the AgencyÂs work not only to policymakers but also to civil society, scientists and the business community. The Scientific Forum on energy for development and the many different side events that would take place during the week were a testament to the broad scope of the work of the Agency and its application in everyday life. 

21. She acknowledged the service of Mr Mohammed ElBaradei in his 12-year stewardship of the Agency. Since he had taken on the role of Director General in 1997, the Agency had seen a number of challenges to the nuclear non-proliferation regime. Professional, impartial and passionate, he had worked consistently and pro-actively with Member States and his staff to meet those challenges and to ensure that the Agency was prepared for others that arose in the future. The Director General had sought to strengthen the three pillars underpinning the AgencyÂs mission, a demanding task recognised by the award of the Nobel Peace Prize in 2005. 

22. The bar had been set high for Ambassador Yukiya Amano, the Director General-elect. Member States could all look forward to working with him and supporting him in that demanding role. 

23. She pledged her full commitment to achieving the objectives of the 53rd General Conference and said she would spare no effort in encouraging dialogue among delegations and regional groups so that the spirit of Vienna might prevail. 

24. She recalled that, pursuant to Rules 34 and 40 of the Rules of Procedure, the Conference had to elect 8 Vice-Presidents, the Chairman of the Committee of the Whole, and 5 additional members of the General Committee Â resulting in a General Committee of 15 members, with herself as its Chairperson. However, in the current year the General Committee would be composed of 16 members, consisting of 8 Vice-Presidents and 6 additional members, so that the area of South East Asia and the 
Pacific, in addition to providing the President of the Conference, could also have a Vice-President. That would involve suspension of Rules 34 and 40 of the Rules of Procedure of the General Conference, as had been done in comparable situations in the past. 
25. It was so agreed. 

26. She proposed that the delegates of Finland, the Islamic Republic of Iran, Mongolia, Peru, the Russian Federation, Singapore, Sudan and the United States of America be elected as Vice-Presidents; that Mr Smith (United Kingdom) be elected as Chairman of the Committee of the Whole, and that the delegates of Belarus, Canada, Cuba, Italy, Lebanon and the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya be elected as additional members of the General Committee. 

27. The PresidentÂs proposals were accepted. 

28. The PRESIDENT further proposed that the General Conference deal with items 2, 3, 4, 6, 7 and 8 Â in that order Â pending receipt of the General CommitteeÂs recommendation on the provisional agenda. 

29. The PresidentÂs proposal was accepted. 

2. Applications for membership of the Agency 
(GC(53)/21 and 22) 

30. The PRESIDENT drew attention to documents GC(53)/21 and GC(53)/22 containing applications for membership made by the Kingdom of Cambodia and the Republic of Rwanda, respectively. Both applications had been endorsed by the Board of Governors, which had also submitted two draft resolutions for adoption by the General Conference. 

31. She took it that the Conference wished to adopt the two draft resolutions. 

32. It was so decided. 

33. Mr SITTHIPHONG (Thailand) congratulated Cambodia on behalf of the ASEAN delegations to the General Conference and welcomed its membership of the Agency. 

3. Message from the Secretary-General of the United Nations 
34. Mr DUARTE (United Nations High Representative for Disarmament Affairs) read out the following message: 
ÂI am pleased to send my greetings to the fifty-third session of the General Conference of the International Atomic Energy Agency. 
ÂI wish to take this opportunity to thank Dr Mohamed ElBaradei for his many years of outstanding service to humanity and to international peace and security. I also extend my full support to the new Director General, Ambassador Yukiya Amano, as he prepares to confront the many challenges ahead. 
ÂThe IAEA has a strong foundation upon which to build. It has expanded international cooperation in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy, while reducing the risks of nuclear proliferation and terrorism. It has cooperated closely with other international organizations and has a longstanding working relationship with the UN Secretariat. 
ÂAs you know, on 24 September, the Security Council will convene a high-level summit to address nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation. This historic event will provide a timely opportunity to revitalize the global disarmament and non-proliferation agenda and to reaffirm the contributions of the IAEA in the areas of verification, transparency and irreversibility. 
ÂConcerns over the dangers of nuclear weapons proliferation have highlighted the importance of the AgencyÂs safeguards system and the need for universal adherence to the additional protocol. I hope that the non-nuclear-weapon States that are party to the NPT but which have not brought their comprehensive safeguards agreements into force will do so before the 2010 NPT Review Conference. I urge all parties to cooperate fully with the IAEA in resolving issues that might arise relating to safeguards agreements. 
ÂThis General Conference also provides a useful opportunity to reaffirm international support for resuming the six-party talks aimed at the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. 
ÂNuclear safety and security are also essential for expanding the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. New levels of cooperation will also be needed to address challenges such as spent fuel, waste management and transportation. Member States have also made constructive proposals, including to enhance the assurance of nuclear fuel supply. 
ÂGreat progress is possible in all these fields. Please accept my best wishes for a successful conference.Â 
4. Statement by the Director General 

35. The DIRECTOR GENERAL expressed pride in the considerable progress the Agency had made in many areas, from improving access to energy, food and water for people in need, to helping to enhance the safety and security of nuclear materials and facilities, since his first statement to the General Conference as Director General in 1998. It was troubling, however, that so many of the issues he had raised back then still prevailed: nuclear verification in the DPRK, the lack of any significant progress in nuclear disarmament and the perennial problems of inadequate Agency funding and legal authority. 
36. The world had changed dramatically after the atrocities of 11 September 2001. It had been necessary to respond to the uncovering of a sophisticated covert network dealing in sensitive nuclear technology, which had made it alarmingly easy to acquire nuclear weaponsÂ knowledge and technology. Nine States now possessed nuclear weapons and there was a growing number of nuclear weapons capable countries which, because of their mastery of uranium enrichment or plutonium reprocessing, could manufacture nuclear weapons within a few months if their security perceptions changed. 
37. A major cause for regret had been the fact that, despite the Agency and the United Nations providing impartial and factual information that had pointed to the absence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, a war had been launched against that country, with tragic consequences. 
38. Back in the 1990s, it had not been uncommon for world leaders to stumble over the name of the IAEA because of its unfamiliarity. Now, the Agency had become a household name. The ultimate recognition of its work, of course, had come with the award of the 2005 Nobel Peace Prize. 
39. The Agency had a proud story to tell when it came to efficiency. The United Nations Secretary-GeneralÂs High-level Panel had described the Agency in 2004 as an Âextraordinary bargain.Â The staff of the Agency could take pride in their achievements. 
40. Looking back at his statement to the General Conference in 1998 had helped him to take stock of what had been achieved in the past 12 years, to consider what lessons needed to be learned and to offer a perspective on the challenges that lay ahead. 
41. Starting with nuclear power, he said that when he had addressed the 42nd General Conference nuclear power had stopped growing in Western Europe and North America. The outlook had been quite uncertain in other parts of the world. The Chernobyl accident had still been fresh in peopleÂs memories. Public opinion had associated nuclear power with the possibility of a major disaster and concerns about the disposal of radioactive waste. Today, by contrast, the world seemed set for a significant expansion in the use of nuclear power, with scores of countries having told the Agency that they were interested in introducing it. Not surprisingly, most of those were from the developing world, where annual electricity consumption per capita could be as low as 50 kW?h compared with an average of 8600 kW?h in OECD countries. For many countries, nuclear power, with its good performance and safety record, was a way to meet their surging demand for energy, reduce their vulnerability to fluctuations in the cost of fossil fuels and combat climate change. 
42. The Agency was not a lobbyist for nuclear power. Its role was to provide objective, comparative information. If a country made the decision to add nuclear power to its energy mix, the Agency worked to ensure that it was done effectively, in the safest and most secure manner and exclusively for peaceful purposes. A considerable expansion in the number of nuclear power reactors throughout the world would create extra work for the Agency. The Agency had already adjusted its priorities to focus more on the nuclear power programmes of newcomers. 
43. As regards other aspects of the development side of the AgencyÂs mandate, namely making nuclear techniques available to developing countries to help them meet the basic needs of their peoples, he recalled that in 1998 the size of the AgencyÂs technical cooperation programme had been modest, at around US $80 million per year. Ten years later, in 2008, the programme had disbursed $96 million. That was still disappointingly modest, especially considering the growth in Agency membership in that period from 127 countries to the present 150 and the increasing development needs of Member States. Demand for Agency help greatly exceeded its ability to provide it. The Agency could and should do much more, but that required a dramatic increase in funding which had not been made available. That was as regrettable as it was short-sighted. All Member States should concentrate on delivering assistance where they could, to help provide energy for development, feed the hungry and heal the sick. They should also recognize the link between the security which everyone sought and development. 
44. Improving life for the two billion people Â one third of humanity Â who lived on less than $2 per day was not just the right thing to do morally; it was also the smart thing to do. By helping to address the root causes of instability and insecurity, including poverty, poor governance and endemic conflicts, Member States made it less likely that countries would feel the temptation to seek weapons of mass destruction. It had been an uphill battle to get more developed Member States to recognize the importance of the AgencyÂs development activities and accept the need to fund them adequately. That should not be perceived as an act of largesse, rather a commitment to development. In the meantime, the Agency was doing everything it could to make its assistance as effective as possible. 
45. One project dear to his heart was the Programme of Action for Cancer Therapy (PACT), an innovative effort to bring radiation medicine activities into comprehensive national and regional cancer control programmes. With the incidence of cancer increasing dramatically in developing countries, their needs were great. For example, 27 of the 53 countries in Africa had no operating radiotherapy services at all; no prevention, no screening, no early diagnosis and no palliative care programmes. He expressed the hope that PACT would attract more governmental and non-governmental donors to help save millions of lives. 
46. The AgencyÂs technical cooperation activities had made a significant difference. The use of nuclear techniques for induced mutations to improve such crops as rice, cotton and wheat had provided better nutrition and greater food security and improved economic prospects for farmers, while the use of isotope data was helping to ensure reliable supplies of groundwater. 
47. The global non-proliferation landscape had changed radically in the past two decades and in response, Agency safeguards had undergone a metamorphosis. Implementation had moved beyond simple verification of declared nuclear material at declared facilities to assessing information on a StateÂs entire nuclear programme and, most importantly, verifying the absence of undeclared activities. 
48. The AgencyÂs ability to detect possible clandestine nuclear material and activities depended on the extent to which it was given the necessary legal authority, technology and resources to do so. Regrettably, it faced continuing major shortcomings in all three areas, which, if not addressed, could put the entire non-proliferation regime at risk. 
49. As far as the AgencyÂs legal authority was concerned, he had expressed the hope to the 42nd General Conference that all States would have concluded safeguards agreements and an additional protocol by 2000. That now looked wildly optimistic. Today, there were still 25 NPT non-nuclear-weapon States without comprehensive safeguards agreements in force, which meant that the Agency could not draw any non-proliferation conclusions for those countries. There were 73 countries with comprehensive safeguards agreements, but no additional protocols in force. For those countries, the AgencyÂs ability to detect possible undeclared activities was severely limited. He stressed that universal adherence by all non-nuclear-weapon States to comprehensive safeguards agreements and additional protocols was a prerequisite for an effective verification and non-proliferation system. 
50. The AgencyÂs credibility depended on its independence. It was vital for it to have state-of-theÂ­art technology so that, for example, it could independently validate environmental sampling analyses. Moreover, the burden on the safeguards staff was growing steadily, as the number of facilities they had to inspect increased. Continuing with budgets that fell far short of the AgencyÂs essential needs in the coming years was not a viable option. 
51. Back in 1998, there had been two main countries on the proliferation radar. In the case of Iraq, he recalled that he had reported to the Security Council two months before the Iraq war that the Agency Âhad found no evidence that Iraq has revived its nuclear weapons programmeÂ. He had asked for a few more months as a Âvaluable investment in peaceÂ to let the Agency complete its verification work. Unfortunately, the AgencyÂs assessment and that of the United Nations Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission (UNMOVIC) had been ignored and a war had been waged which had cost the lives of possibly hundreds of thousands of innocent civilians. It gave him no consolation that the AgencyÂs findings had been subsequently vindicated. 
52. In the case of the DPRK, the Agency had sounded the alarm and reported the country to the Security Council for non-compliance with its non-proliferation obligations as far back as 1993. Sixteen years later, the DPRK had moved from the possession of undeclared plutonium to acquiring 
nuclear weapons. The Âon-again, off-again natureÂ of the dialogue between the DPRK and the international community had stymied resolution of that issue. In his view, the DPRK was a glaring example of the fragility and shortcomings of the non-proliferation regime. 
53. Important lessons needed to be learned from Iraq and the DPRK. The first was that diplomacy and thorough verification must be allowed to take their course, however lengthy and tiresome the process might be. It was important to keep channels of communication open with parties with whom there were issues that needed to be resolved, rather than to seek to isolate them. Action must be taken within the framework of international institutions, like the Agency and the Security Council, and those institutions must be empowered, rather than bypassed through unilateral action. Force should never be used unless every other option had been exhausted, and then only within the bounds of international law, as codified in the Charter of the United Nations. The Agency could not do its work in isolation. It depended on a supportive political process, with the Security Council at its core. The Council needed to develop a comprehensive compliance mechanism that did not rely only on sanctions, which too often hurt the vulnerable and the innocent. It must focus on conflict prevention, peacekeeping and peacemaking and address the insecurities that lay behind many cases of proliferation, such as mistrust and conflict. As the world, hopefully, moved towards nuclear disarmament, the AgencyÂs verification mandate should be expanded and strengthened. 
54. Six years had passed since Iran had been reported to the Board of Governors for failing to declare material and activities to the Agency, in violation of its safeguards agreement. As a result of difficult and painstaking work over that period, the Agency had acquired a better understanding of IranÂs civil nuclear programme. Nevertheless, a number of questions and allegations that cast doubt on the peaceful nature of that programme remained outstanding. If confidence in the exclusively peaceful nature of its nuclear programme was to be restored, Iran must engage substantively with the Agency to clarify those issues, especially the difficult and important questions regarding the authenticity of information relating to alleged weaponization studies. He called on those who had provided the information to enable the Agency to share with Iran as much information as possible in order to assist the Agency in moving forward with the verification process. It was also essential that Iran implement the additional protocol so that the Agency could verify the absence of undeclared nuclear material and activities in Iran. Addressing the international communityÂs concerns about IranÂs future intentions was primarily a matter of confidence building, which could only be achieved through dialogue. He therefore welcomed the offer of the United States of America to initiate a dialogue with Iran, without preconditions and on the basis of mutual respect. It was his hope that such a dialogue would begin as soon as possible. 
55. One of his preoccupations as he reflected on the future of Agency safeguards was that it was becoming increasingly difficult to call on non-nuclear-weapon States to renounce such weapons in perpetuity and accept new measures to strengthen non-proliferation if nuclear-weapon States continued to modernize, and almost glorify, their nuclear arsenals. As President Obama had pointed out in his recent landmark Prague speech, serious nuclear disarmament was essential if the nuclear-weapon States were to have the moral authority to deal with the challenges facing the non-proliferation regime. 
56. There had been times in the past 12 years when he had felt like one of a few lonely voices calling for nuclear disarmament, not least when the non-proliferation regime had begun losing some of its legitimacy in the eyes of the public, notably in the Middle East. Fortunately, after two largely lost decades after the end of the cold war, the tide now seemed to be turning. That reflected above all a realization that, with the technology no longer securely locked up and an increasing risk of terrorism, the danger of nuclear weapons being used had increased considerably. The recent commitment by Presidents Medvedev and Obama to cut the nuclear arsenals of the Russian Federation and the United States, respectively, by as much as a third was very encouraging. 
57. In 2003, he had expressed his belief that the fuel cycle could prove to be the Achilles heel of the non-proliferation regime and he had raised the idea of putting the fuel cycle under multinational control. He had recently placed proposals before the Board of Governors to establish an LEU bank and an LEU reserve in Russia, under Agency auspices. No country would have to give up any of its rights under the NPT, including the right to develop its own fuel cycle. The ultimate goal should continue to be the full multinationalization of the sensitive parts of the fuel cycle in order to guarantee supply of nuclear fuel and consolidate efforts to move to a world free from nuclear weapons. 
58. Turning to nuclear safety, he said that in 2008 the Agency had been proud to celebrate the 50th anniversary of its safety standards programme. Nuclear safety had improved significantly since the shock of Chernobyl in 1986, but the risk of accidents could never be eliminated completely. The combination of old reactors and weak regulators in some countries was still troubling. It was in the interests of all to ensure that the highest safety standards were upheld everywhere. 
59. The AgencyÂs activities in nuclear security dated back to the 1970s, when it had begun a modest programme that had provided training courses on the physical protection of nuclear materials. After the attacks of 11 September 2001, however, it had become clear that more needed to be done urgently, and the Agency had initiated a comprehensive programme to combat the risk of nuclear terrorism. He was proud of the speed and efficiency with which the Agency had turned a small programme with a budget of $250 000 a year, into a major asset for Member States, which had provided $50 million in equipment, training and other assistance in the past three years. It was disconcerting, however, that nuclear security was still funded almost entirely from voluntary contributions, which came with many conditions attached and were both insufficient and unpredictable. The gravest threat faced by the world was of an extremist group getting hold of nuclear weapons or materials. 
60. The Agency had a proud story to tell in terms of efficiency. Keeping the Secretariat lean had been a management priority throughout his tenure. Unfortunately, despite its proven record of effectiveness and efficiency, the Agency found itself fighting exactly the same battles for resources at the start of every budget cycle. He was baffled that some Member States believed they could continue, year after year, to enjoy the benefits of the AgencyÂs programme without putting in many, if any, additional resources, and without loss of quality, especially against a background of zero growth budget policies for most of the past two decades. While no one could see exactly what lay ahead, it was clear that the Agency must be properly equipped to deal with not only the unexpected, but also what was foreseeable. The sums needed to put Agency funding on a secure footing for the coming decades were insignificant, especially compared to the magnitude and range of the challenges and risks it had to address. 
61. Looking to the future, he said it was clear that tremendous challenges, but also tremendous opportunities, lay ahead for the Agency. Nuclear disarmament was finally back on the agenda. If, as he hoped, it proceeded successfully, a significant additional verification role would be created for the Agency as a natural extension of its work. Furthermore, in 50 yearsÂ time, there could be several dozen additional countries with nuclear power programmes, mostly in the developing world. Considering that most of the 30 countries which already had nuclear power would build additional plants, that meant more work for the Agency in helping with capacity building, quality assurance, verification, safety and security. Demand for nuclear techniques in medicine, agriculture and other areas would continue to grow and the Agency would remain the first port of call for developing countries. 
62. The AgencyÂs dual mandate of security and development was unique. It was part of a complex web of international security mechanisms that had to work in harmony if the people who had placed their trust in the Agency were to be served effectively. He did not share the prevailing cynicism about international organizations. Like all human endeavours, they had their weaknesses but they were capable of great things if properly resourced and empowered and competently led. The Agency was 
one of the finest and most effective organizations in the world today, with staff of exceptionally high calibre. Its strength lay in its objectivity and its outstanding technical competence. He urged Member States to invest in it and to cherish it. 
63. According to the Egyptian-born poet Constantine Cavafy: ÂWhen you set out on your journey... pray that the road is long, full of adventure, full of knowledgeÂ. His own journey with the Agency had indeed been long and there had been many adventures. It had been an honour and a privilege for him to serve as Director General for 12 years. He was deeply grateful to all his colleagues, past and present, for their sterling professionalism, their loyalty and their dedication. Without them, the Agency would not be where it was today. He thanked Member States for honouring him with their confidence. 
64. Having congratulated his successor, Director General-designate Amano, he wished him every success and offered him his full support. He trusted that he would lead the Agency with vision, impartiality and courage. 
65. After a lifetime as a diplomat and international civil servant, he knew that diplomacy and negotiation could be tedious. The lessons of history had been, however, that force rarely solved problems so it was better to follow the path of diplomacy. For diplomacy to succeed, States must act as one family, with the conviction that all human beings had a right to live in dignity and peace, free from fear and free from want, under a global security system that did not rely on inhumane weapons and was rooted in fairness and equity. 
66. He concluded by recalling the concept of Ubuntu, the essential spirit of the continent of Africa, from which he came and to which he owed a debt of gratitude. Ubuntu was the recognition of the inextricable bonds that linked all human beings, and that no one existed in isolation: ÂI am, because you areÂ. 
6. Approval of the appointment of the Director General 
(GC(53)/6 and 11) 

67. The PRESIDENT, referring to document GC(53)/6, declared that, pursuant to Article VII.A of the Statute, the Board had decided to appoint Mr Yukiya Amano to serve as Director General of the Agency for a term of four years from 1 December 2009 to 30 November 2013 and had requested the General Conference to approve that appointment by adopting the draft resolution contained in document GC(53)/6. She took it that the General Conference wished to adopt the draft resolution contained in document GC(53)/6. 

68. It was so decided and the Conference confirmed the appointment of Mr Amano to the post of Director General by acclamation. 

At the invitation of the President, Mr Amano entered the meeting. 

69. The PRESIDENT informed Mr Amano that the General Conference had approved his appointment to the post of Director General. She was pleased to be the first to congratulate him on behalf of the General Conference and to wish him a successful tenure. She invited him to take the oath of office. 

70. Mr AMANO took the following oath: 
"I solemnly swear to exercise in all loyalty, discretion and conscience the functions entrusted to me as Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency, to discharge these functions and to regulate my conduct with the interest of the Agency only in view, and not to seek or accept instructions in regard to the performance of my duties from any Government or other authority external to the Agency." 
71. Mr AMANO said that he was greatly honoured that the General Conference had approved his appointment as the next Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency. He humbly accepted that appointment and expressed his sincere gratitude to Member States for their support and trust. 

72. He expressed his profound respect to Mr ElBaradei for his outstanding contribution to the Agency during his 12-year tenure. His tireless efforts and selfless dedication to world peace and prosperity would undoubtedly be remembered. He wished him good health and all the very best for the future. 

73. His own appointment had occurred during a period of slow but continuous change for the Agency. Those changes included increasing risks of nuclear proliferation and nuclear terrorism, the rise in demand for energy coupled with concerns about increased greenhouse gas emissions, food security, water availability, human health and the continuing difficulties of the global economy. All of those challenges were global issues, and the Agency had the ability and responsibility to address them using nuclear technologies. 

74. Nuclear power generation could be an option for meeting increasing energy needs without significant amounts of greenhouse gas emissions. Developed and developing countries alike must be able to enjoy the advantages of nuclear power if they decided to introduce it. The application of radioisotopes could provide various benefits, including a boost in food production. Nuclear medicine was an effective tool to protect human health, especially in the fight against cancer. Natural resources such as water could be better managed through the use of nuclear technology. In those endeavours, the AgencyÂs technical cooperation deserved particular attention, as it was indispensable in enabling people throughout the world to benefit from the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. 

75. Other important issues were nuclear safety and security. Ensuring safety and security was critical in gaining the international communityÂs wider support and better recognition of nuclear technology as safe and secure. The Agency should continue to play a vital role in those fields. 

76. The spread of nuclear weapons and nuclear terrorism was an increasing threat for the international community. As science and technology continued to advance, as knowledge dissemination increased and as the movement of people and commodities became a more critical factor, the world faced increasing risks of nuclear proliferation and nuclear terrorism. It was unlikely that that trend would ever be reversed; rather, it would probably accelerate. Thus further efforts needed to be made to offset that trend by universalizing and further strengthening the nuclear non-proliferation regime, especially the AgencyÂs safeguards system. Safeguards agreements with States must be implemented fully, professionally and impartially with the full cooperation of all the States concerned. Those efforts, in their turn, would facilitate the increased use of nuclear energy. 

77. Despite the aforementioned worrying aspects, there was a recent positive development, namely the emerging hope for progress in nuclear disarmament. If that hope was translated into a concrete result, the Agency might have a role to play in verification. While well placed to address the global issues he had just mentioned, the AgencyÂs contribution could be maximized only when it pursued, in a balanced manner, its dual objective of ensuring the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and promoting the peaceful uses of nuclear energy, including technical cooperation. Merely being a nuclear watchdog would not suffice and nor would promoting the peaceful uses of nuclear energy 
alone. The Agency, in spite of its advantages, could not address those global issues on its own. Many other actors and stakeholders shared the same objectives at various levels. It was therefore necessary for the Agency to cooperate with Member States, international and regional organizations, international forums and civil societies. He intended to identify and build on the AgencyÂs comparative advantages so as to achieve greater synergy in a wider context. 
78. Constant efforts to enhance the quality of management were needed for the Agency to remain an effective and efficient organization. Priorities must be clearly defined so as to make maximum use of available resources, and any waste of resources must be eliminated. Communication between the Secretariat and Member States and between different parts of the Secretariat must continue to be improved in order to enhance efficiency and avoid duplication. Such efforts would be particularly called for if the General Conference approved an increase in the AgencyÂs budget despite the difficult global economic situation. The Agency had an excellent and dedicated body of staff in which he had full confidence. Their expertise and professional skills were its greatest asset. It would be his responsibility to maintain the best possible working environment, and that was an area he aimed to build on further. 

79. Having been entrusted with the responsibilities of chief administrative officer of the Agency, he pledged to manage the Agency in an impartial and reliable manner, under the authority and subject to the control of the Board of Governors, and for the benefit of all Member States. 

80. As JapanÂs Ambassador in Vienna and Governor of the Agency until recently, he had been honoured to meet and form friendships with so many truly distinguished Governors and Ambassadors. He hoped to maintain those good contacts and to continue to build on that close cooperation in all areas. 

81. In conclusion, he said that he was looking forward to working in close cooperation with the members of the Board so that the Agency could contribute to addressing global issues as a united and unified organization. 

82. The PRESIDENT took it that the Conference wished to adopt the draft resolution in document GC(53)/11 conferring the title of Director General Emeritus on the outgoing Director General. 

83. The draft resolution in document GC(53)/11 was adopted by acclamation. 

84. The PRESIDENT paid tribute to Mr ElBaradei on behalf of the General Conference for his outstanding leadership of the Agency over the past 12 years. Expressing the hope that he would continue to make his experience available to the Agency and make the best possible use of the title of Director General Emeritus, she wished him happiness, good health and continued success in the years ahead. 

85. Mr POTTS (Australia), speaking on behalf of the South East Asia and the Pacific Group, said he was delighted to see the appointment of an experienced diplomat from Japan, who knew the Asia and Pacific region well. The Group was encouraged by the broad and inclusive vision that he had articulated of an Agency that focused on non-proliferation and the peaceful use of nuclear energy, safeguards and verification, technical cooperation, and nuclear safety and security. Mr Amano had long been committed to nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament. The Group had great confidence that he would be a highly effective leader of the Agency and assured him of its full support. 

86. The Group also paid tribute to the outgoing Director General and expressed deep appreciation for his outstanding service to the Agency and the international community. 

87. Mr DAVIES (United States of America), speaking on behalf of the North American Group, thanked the outgoing Director General for his tireless work over a dozen years to make the Agency a 
valuable part of the global effort to ensure international peace, security and well-being. Under his leadership, the Agency had been universally recognized for its dual mission of enlarging the peaceful uses of nuclear energy while preventing the proliferation of nuclear weapons. The decision to bestow on him and the Agency the 2005 Nobel Peace Prize was a testament both to his inspired work and to the AgencyÂs vital role in addressing critical global challenges. His commitment to international peace and security and his leadership had earned great respect for the Agency and a safer world for all, in recognition of which the North American Group had been gratified to join in the consensus in bestowing on him the title of Director General Emeritus. 
88. The Group warmly congratulated Mr Amano on his appointment as Director General. As a strong supporter of the Agency in all aspects of its mission, the Group stood ready to assist him in ensuring that the Agency was prepared to meet the growing challenges of the twenty-first century. Under the leadership of Mr ElBaradei and his predecessors, the Agency had emerged as a premier international institution. The Group was confident that Mr Amano, building on that strong foundation, would help Member States to shape the Agency of the future. The Group would continue to do its part to ensure that the Agency had the resources and authority to fulfil its mandate. He underlined its commitment to the AgencyÂs success and confidence in its future leadership. 

89. Mr CURIA (Argentina), speaking on behalf of the Group of 77 and China, expressed acknowledgement and gratitude to Mr ElBaradei for the devotion, dedication and stamina he had displayed over the years during which he had led the Agency and the results he had achieved. The awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize had been just recognition of both the Agency and its Director General, and awarding Mr ElBaradei the title of Director General Emeritus would encourage him further to pledge his knowledge, experience and dedication to the Agency. The Group congratulated the Director General designate, Mr Amano, on the confirmation of his appointment, and expressed the conviction that his leadership, experience and knowledge would consolidate the work of the Agency in continuing to find solutions to problems within its remit and in assuming its responsibilities, taking into account in particular the needs of the developing countries. 

90. Mr SHIM Yoon-Joe (Republic of Korea), speaking on behalf of the Far East region, expressed appreciation for Mr ElBaradeiÂs achievements as Director General, which had been fittingly acknowledged by the awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize. He also congratulated the Director General designate, Mr Amano, on the confirmation of his appointment by acclamation and pledged full cooperation with him in the development and enhancement of the AgencyÂs work and activities. 

7. Contributions to the Technical Cooperation Fund for 2010 
(GC(53)/23) 

91. The PRESIDENT said that on 16 June 2009 the Board of Governors had recommended a figure of $85 million as the target for voluntary contributions to the TCF for 2010. She drew attention to the table in document GC(53)/23 showing the contributions each Member State would need to make in order to meet its share of that target. 
92. The early pledging and payment of contributions to the TCF greatly helped the Secretariat in planning the AgencyÂs technical cooperation programmes and all delegations that were in a position to do so were urged to notify the Secretariat during the current session of the contributions that their Governments would be making for 2010. 
93. She would report at the end of the session, under a later agenda item, on the contributions which had been pledged up to that time. She hoped to be able to report favourably on the percentage of the 2010 target figure already pledged. 
8. General debate and Annual Report for 2008 
(GC(53)/7) 

94. Ms NODA (Japan) said that the Agency played a key role not only in nuclear non-proliferation but also in promoting the peaceful uses of atomic energy in fields such as nuclear safety and security as well as technical cooperation, and thus it was one of the most important international organizations in the maintenance of peace and prosperity for humanity. Under the leadership of Director General ElBaradei, the Agency had gained an increased level of confidence and wider recognition by the international community. She expressed JapanÂs sincere appreciation to him for his many accomplishments over the years. 

95. Japan had been making significant contributions both as a member of the Board of Governors since the AgencyÂs foundation and as a model country in terms of the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. The knowledge and experience Japan had acquired in that field had been shared widely and constructively with many developing countries by means of technical cooperation. While adhering to its three non-nuclear principles of not possessing or producing nuclear weapons or permitting their introduction into Japan, her country had also been contributing to strengthening and developing the AgencyÂs safeguards system by sharing its advanced safeguards technology. 

96. Japan, in close cooperation with all Member States, was determined to continue making contributions to the Agency aimed at its further development and reinforcement. The nomination of Ambassador Amano as a candidate for the post of Director General had been evidence of that determination and Japan had been delighted that the appointment had been approved. She expressed JapanÂs gratitude for the valuable support extended to him by Member States. Japan, convinced that the Agency would continue to develop and be reinforced further under Mr AmanoÂs leadership, asked all Member States to unify with a view to tackling the difficult issues the international community faced. 

97. In recent years, in response to the growing demand for energy and to global warming, the international community had begun re-evaluating the role of nuclear energy. In view of the gathering momentum of the peaceful uses of nuclear energy, including nuclear power generation, it was necessary to give due consideration to safeguards, safety and security (the 3SÂs). An initiative had been launched at the G8 Hokkaido Toyako Summit in 2008 to encourage countries considering the introduction of nuclear power generation to ensure the 3SÂs. As a follow-up activity to that initiative, Japan would, in cooperation with the Agency, continue to hold regional seminars on the subject and planned to host an international conference in 2010 on nuclear security for Asia particularly for countries introducing nuclear power programmes. 

98. Cooperation was essential in the various stages of preparation necessary for the introduction of nuclear power, including the development of human resources and the establishment of legal and regulatory frameworks. For its part, Japan would extend various kinds of assistance, including the sharing of its experience and knowledge through multilateral and bilateral cooperation. It would continue to cooperate with the Agency in expanding assistance to those countries planning to introduce nuclear power generation, including through extrabudgetary contributions for the 
development of national infrastructure for nuclear power plants, through the dispatching of experts, and by contributing actively to related international conferences. 
99. With a view to strengthening efforts to combat global warming, it was necessary to mobilize all effective technologies, including those related to nuclear energy. Nuclear technology should not be excluded when considering the role of the clean development mechanism. 

100. On the assurance of nuclear fuel supply, Japan had hosted the seminar on global nuclear fuel supply at Agency headquarters in January 2009, the purpose of which had been to allow for information sharing and fact finding on issues relating to the front end of the nuclear fuel cycle. Japan hoped that such initiatives would contribute to fostering an environment that would facilitate discussions at the Agency on the assurance of nuclear fuel supply. Japan would continue to participate proactively in such discussions. 

101. Technical cooperation should continue to be one of the AgencyÂs main pillars as it could effectively address the needs of many Member States. Japan, with its long history and numerous achievements in the field of radiation application, recognized the important role of nuclear science and technology in socio-economic development and would continue to make technical and personnel contributions relating to the utilization of isotopes in medical, industrial and other areas. 

102. As a member, and currently chair, of the RCA, Japan had been contributing to joint research, development and training on nuclear science and technology for developing countries in the Asia-Pacific region. It had also been playing an important role in promoting the peaceful uses of nuclear energy in Asia through the Forum for Nuclear Cooperation in Asia (FNCA). 

103. Japan, as the only country to have suffered atomic bombings, had been at the forefront of international efforts aimed at the elimination of nuclear weapons and therefore welcomed the momentum that nuclear disarmament had gathered recently. The 2010 NPT Review Conference represented an extremely important milestone in that regard. To contribute to its success, Japan would be submitting a draft resolution on the elimination of nuclear weapons to the General Assembly in 2009, as had been the case for the past 15 years. Also, it would strengthen its efforts to promote the entry into force of the CTBT and strongly hoped that the International Commission on Nuclear Non-proliferation and Disarmament, which was a Japanese-Australian initiative, would propose concrete and practical recommendations to help strengthen the NPT regime. 

104. The strengthening of Agency safeguards was especially vital for the enhancement of the non-proliferation regime. Japan had always ensured international confidence in its activities by maintaining a high level of transparency and had been shifting to integrated safeguards. It was currently engaged in consultations with the Agency towards the development of an integrated safeguards State level approach. Japan was determined to play a leading role globally in that regard. The most realistic and effective way to strengthen safeguards was through universalization of the additional protocol. Japan would continue actively to promote that universalization by hosting the Asian Senior-level Talks on Non-Proliferation (ASTOP) meetings and relevant Agency seminars. Japan attached great importance to ensuring and improving the AgencyÂs independent analytical capabilities and with that in mind had made a contribution to help strengthen the functions of the Safeguards Analytical Laboratory. 

105. The DPRK had launched a missile on 5 April 2009 and had conducted a nuclear test on 25 May 2009. In addition, it had launched a ballistic missile on 4 July 2009, in contravention of Security Council resolution 1874 (2009). The DPRKÂs nuclear and missile programmes, which posed a grave threat to the peace and security of north-east Asia and beyond, were totally unacceptable. The international community should work to implement Security Council resolutions 1718 (2006) and 1874 (2009) and should demonstrate clearly that it would never tolerate the possession of nuclear 
weapons by the DPRK. Japan was seeking to normalize its relationship with the DPRK through a comprehensive resolution of such outstanding matters as the abduction of Japanese nationals, nuclear and missile issues, and settlement of the unfortunate past. It continued to work actively towards a peaceful resolution of the nuclear issues. 
106. Regrettably, the Islamic Republic of Iran had continued to expand its uranium enrichment related activities in defiance of calls by the international community. To remove the concerns of the international community and to gain its confidence, Iran must cooperate fully with the Agency and respond sincerely to the requirements set forth by the relevant Board and Security Council resolutions. Japan would continue to work towards a peaceful and diplomatic resolution of the issue in concert with the international community. 
107. Stressing the importance of nuclear safety, she pointed to JapanÂs specific knowledge and experience in ensuring the seismic safety of nuclear power plants. In order to share that know-how, it was planning to host an Agency international workshop in 2009 in the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa region, which had recently suffered an earthquake. Another contribution Japan intended to make to nuclear safety in Asia was by taking a lead in the fields of emergency preparedness and response, education and training, and radioactive waste management in the Asian Nuclear Safety Network. It would continue actively to support the AgencyÂs efforts and activities geared towards ensuring nuclear safety, including seismic safety, and would continue to make extrabudgetary contributions to that end. 
108. The safe transport of radioactive materials was another essential aspect of the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. Based on the right of freedom of navigation under international law, Japan would continue to conduct such transport, while employing the most stringent safety measures in accordance with international standards. It would also continue to engage in confidence-building dialogue with shipping and coastal States. 
109. It was vital that the international community stand together and work against the threat posed by nuclear terrorism. The various activities conducted by the Agency through its Nuclear Security Fund, helped significantly to enhance nuclear security in individual countries. Japan would continue providing its assistance to help bolster nuclear security, mainly in Asia, with its contributions to the Nuclear Security Fund. In addition, Japan would cooperate with the countries concerned towards the success of the Global Summit on Nuclear Security proposed by President Obama for 2010. 
110. The AgencyÂs core missions, aimed at enhancing the well-being of the global population, would continue to grow. Nuclear science and technology were clearly essential for daily life. The Agency should continue to contribute to addressing urgent issues on the global agenda, such as energy security, climate change, water issues, poverty eradication and cancer therapy. To that end, Japan strongly believed that the climate of cooperation among Member States needed to be further cultivated. Japan, for its part, would continue to share its knowledge and experience with the Agency so as to make further contributions toward peace, health and prosperity. It would continue to play a leading role as a bridge in the international community, aiming to deepen the sense of cooperation among Member States and to imbue a new spirit of Vienna. 
111. Ms AYITTEY (Ghana), having conveyed the best wishes of President Professor John Atta Mills for a successful General Conference, reaffirmed the continued importance and relevance of the Agency as the only global body committed to ensuring that nuclear technology and its applications were used for peaceful purposes for the benefit of mankind. Referring to the Annual Report for 2008, she said that the Agency had demonstrated inter alia a clear commitment to the promotion of international cooperation in its efforts to help maintain the level of global nuclear safety that was needed. Those activities had not been limited to the nuclear powers, but had Â commendably Â covered all Member States both individually and as members of the various regions of the world. 
112. Ghana attached great importance to the AgencyÂs technical cooperation programme and appreciated its role in partnering Member States from Africa in using nuclear science and technology to address their socio-economic needs in human health, nutrition, agriculture, energy, industry and the environment. Ghana applauded the collaboration between the Agency and AFRA in the development and implementation of regional projects. Ghana supported AFRAÂs efforts to maximize the use of the available infrastructure and expertise in Africa in the field of nuclear science and technology towards the achievement of regional self-sufficiency and the development of strategies for concrete problem solving and thematic planning. To strengthen those efforts, Ghana invited Member States with nuclear educational institutions to support the regionÂs effort to establish an African Network for Education in Nuclear Science and Technology (AFRA-NEST) to promote, manage and preserve nuclear knowledge for the sustainability of nuclear technology in Africa. 
113. Research scientists from the Ghana Atomic Energy Commission and other national research institutions and universities were engaged in various activities using nuclear and biotechnological techniques which were well aligned to the Country Programme Framework. GhanaÂs nuclear capabilities were dedicated not only to research, education and training but also to the promotion of commercialization aimed at achieving sustainability in its research activities. Continued investment in research and development and the effective harnessing of technology in agriculture, health and infrastructural development were vital if the United Nations Millennium Development Goals were to be achieved. It was GhanaÂs main objective, therefore, to ensure that nuclear and related techniques continued to play a critical role in its crop improvement, pest management, food preservation, medical sterilization, radiotherapy, nuclear medicine and petrochemical and mining industries. 
114. Ghana was pleased to note the AgencyÂs considerable work in cancer treatment. Early detection, which was crucial for effective treatment, was almost impossible without the requisite equipment and trained personnel. Ghana had been a beneficiary of the AgencyÂs efforts to address challenges in those areas, particularly through the mobilization of resources for the establishment of the infrastructure necessary for prevention, diagnosis and treatment. Indeed, with the support of the Agency, Ghana had been able to secure a loan of $13.5 million from the OPEC Fund and the Arab Bank for Economic Development in Africa for the upgrading and expansion of radiotherapy centres in Accra and Kumasi. There were plans to establish a third centre in Tamale to serve the northern part of Ghana and the neighbouring West African countries which did not have radiotherapy facilities. Ghana was profoundly grateful to the Director General and the staff of the PACT Office in that regard. 
115. Since the availability of talented and qualified human resources would ultimately ensure sustainability and growth in the use of both non-power and power applications in Ghana and Africa as a whole, Ghana had sought to strengthen its relevant institutions. The Graduate School of Nuclear and Allied Sciences of the University of Ghana, established in cooperation with the Agency in 2006, had recently been audited and favourably recommended for approval and recognition as an AFRA regional designated centre for professional and higher education. Ghana remained grateful to the Agency for its assistance in the establishment of that institution, for providing funds for students to pursue PhD sandwich programmes, and for the supply of vital equipment for student laboratory exercises and research. By way of building on that assistance and to further strengthen institutional capacity, Ghana had also established a national accelerator facility to complement the use of its existing nuclear facilities. That and other developments in its nuclear industry would in the long term require increased levels of manpower capacity in its nuclear institutions. 
116. To promote the number of women in the nuclear industry, Ghana was encouraging its female students to pursue scientific courses and careers. To complement GhanaÂs own efforts, she asked the Agency to consider offering scholarships to Ghanaian and other African students, especially girls, to pursue postgraduate studies in nuclear science and technology, and to help expand the resource pool of women in the nuclear field for national and continent-wide development. 
117. Amid the challenges of climate change and energy insecurity, there was the need for urgent and decisive action to address the issues of food security, agricultural development and the lack of potable water, particularly in African Member States, which often suffered the adverse effects of erratic rainfall patterns resulting in long periods of drought and sometimes floods. In that regard, Ghana welcomed and supported the use of the isotope hydrology technique, initiated by the Agency. Ghana also expressed its appreciation to the Agency for the development and use of the sterile insect technique for the suppression and eradication of tsetse flies, and further development of the technique for the elimination of the anopheles mosquito that caused malaria. 
118. Sustainable development was not attainable without reliable access to energy. The non-availability or inadequate supply of electricity in many African countries, including Ghana, had been a major factor in the continentÂs slow development. For that reason, Ghana and some other African countries were considering the introduction of nuclear electricity as part of their energy mix. It would facilitate access by rural and urban communities to uninterrupted electricity, bringing with it opportunities for communities to engage in more beneficial commercial enterprises to improve their standard of life and to improve industrialization in African countries. Ghana was grateful for the AgencyÂs concerted efforts to assist Member States in developing the requisite infrastructure for nuclear power for electricity generation. However, further assistance by the Agency for the establishment of new nuclear infrastructure and the expansion of existing infrastructure would be needed, and Ghana looked forward to greater collaboration in that regard. 
119. Ghana had initiated the process of establishing an independent regulatory body, to be named the Ghana Nuclear Regulatory Authority, which would be responsible for enhancing the legal, regulatory and radioactive waste management infrastructure to ensure an effective nuclear safety and security regime. Efforts were also being made to ensure early ratification of all international instruments, which would strengthen international confidence in GhanaÂs nuclear programme. Ghana appreciated the AgencyÂs assistance and support in the establishment of its regulatory and legal framework. 
120. Ghana reaffirmed its full support to the Agency in the performance of its statutory duties, and urged recommitment by Member States to its ideals and principles. In that context, Ghana looked forward to enhanced cooperation and partnership with the Agency and its Member States. 
121. In conclusion, she commended Mr ElBaradei, whose tenure of office had had its challenges but whose successes had been great. Ghana saluted him for the able manner in which he had directed the affairs of the Agency in the most difficult of times and wished him well in retirement. Ghana looked forward to working with Mr Amano and stood ready to support him fully in his new task. With the support and cooperation of all Member States, the Agency would be further strengthened to carry out its mandate. 
122. Mr CHU (United States of America) congratulated Mr Amano on his appointment and pledged his GovernmentÂs full support; he also thanked Mr ElBaradei for his quarter-century of distinguished service to the Agency and 12 years as Director General. His leadership had earned him and the Agency a Nobel Peace Prize and the enduring gratitude of the international community. 
123. He read out the following message from President Obama. 
ÂThe United States stands with the IAEA and its Member States in seeking to advance the non-proliferation, energy, and developmental goals embodied in this Agency. These goals advance the common interests of our nations, and the needs of our citizens. They also define the central challenge of the nuclear age Â that of using nuclear energy in ways that prevent proliferation and pursuing the peace and security of a world without nuclear weapons. 
ÂWe know the road to elimination of nuclear weapons will be long and difficult, and can only be achieved if all nations live up to their responsibilities. But we must not defer tough problems to future generations Â there are important steps that we must take to advance the common security of all people. The stakes involved are enormous. Now is the time to strengthen a durable, global regime that prevents the spread of nuclear weapons to additional States or terrorist groups; reduces the worldÂs nuclear weapons; and pursues a world in which nuclear power is used for peaceful purposes. It is for this reason that in Prague last April, I laid out a comprehensive agenda for nuclear arms control and non-proliferation, which you will hear more about later today. 
ÂThe IAEA is central to that agenda and to the establishment of new, durable frameworks for cooperation. To that end, we must ensure that the IAEA has the resources and authority it needs to verify that nuclear programmes are peaceful, to facilitate access to a clean source of energy, and to improve the lives of citizens the world over Â all without incurring new nuclear dangers. 
ÂWorking together, with renewed commitment and the exercise of our shared obligations, we can succeed in making real, substantive progress towards a world that is safer, more secure, and more prosperous. I hope you will join me and my delegation in committing to this goal and to the IAEA and other institutions that support it. 
ÂPlease accept my thanks for your hard work on building a better, more secure future. I wish you all the best for a successful conference.Â 

124. As President Obama had noted, the United States viewed the Agency as essential to solving some of the worldÂs most pressing problems, and to seizing one of its greatest opportunities. By unleashing the energy that bound the nuclei of atoms, a source of energy had been created that could play an important role in helping the world decrease its carbon emissions. But the energy of nuclear reactions had also given the world weapons of enormous destructive capability, so vigilance had to be exercised in guarding against the threats of proliferation. The Agency had been given the daunting task of helping guide the world along that difficult path, of making nuclear power plentiful while ensuring its use was peaceful. The NPT was the cornerstone of the non-proliferation regime, and President Obama had called on all nations to strengthen it. 

125. The Agency would continue to play a vital role in the safe and responsible expansion of nuclear power to combat climate change and promote economic prosperity. President Obama had called for a new framework for civil nuclear cooperation so that all countries could access peaceful nuclear power without increasing the risks of proliferation. That framework could build on commercial models that already existed to provide the necessary tools and reassurance to the market. Binding and enforceable contracts could be extended to those that desired enhanced energy security. Confidence would come in the form of dependable fuel services that addressed the needs associated with all aspects of the commercial fuel cycle. 

126. Around the world, used fuel management remained an important source of uncertainty for nuclear investment. The United States believed that the new civil nuclear framework should seek international cooperation to relieve nuclear fuel consumers of that uncertainty. It was time for governments to work together to take responsibility for managing the back end of the fuel cycle. 

127. For its part, the United States had chosen to step back from an early decision about the final disposition of such material in a geological repository, but was confident that it could safely store it in dry-cask storage for a sufficient period of time while better alternatives were developed. The United States Government would appoint a high-level commission to examine its nuclear waste strategy in light of technical developments and knowledge gained over the past 25 years. It would also continue 
to support mechanisms to reinforce the supply of nuclear fuel, including such measures as the fuel bank proposals put forward by the Russian Federation and the Agency. 
128. The United States had long supported efforts, both bilaterally and multilaterally, to help nations build the necessary infrastructure for safe, secure and responsible use of nuclear energy. It applauded the AgencyÂs efforts in that area and would continue to be a strong supporter through funding and technical expertise. The Department of Energy was also supporting vigorous nuclear power research, including: Generation IV reactors that could burn down long-lived actinides to reduce the amount and lifetime of nuclear waste; modular reactors that could be built and shipped as a single unit and did not need refuelling for an extended period of time; and new fuel processing methods to reduce proliferation risks. 
129. International nuclear cooperation depended on a robust nuclear liability regime. To strengthen that regime, his country encouraged all nations to ratify and bring into force the Convention on Supplementary Compensation for Nuclear Damage. The United States of America was proud to support the work the Agency did to leverage nuclear science for purposes other than energy, for example by pioneering the use of nuclear technology for food, medicine and safe drinking water in order to improve human welfare around the world. 
130. The AgencyÂs continued leadership was needed in strengthening international safeguards. All Member States should grant the Agency the authority to carry out its safeguards mission effectively. That meant bringing into force comprehensive safeguards agreements and additional protocols to make them the accepted verification standard for the world. Earlier in 2009 the United States had brought into force its own additional protocol and it encouraged others to do the same. As information would be the life blood of a strengthened safeguards system, the Agency needed Member StatesÂ support in developing an information-driven approach that went hand-in-hand with inspection access rights to help uncover clandestine activities. In that regard, resources for the AgencyÂs safeguards activities must keep pace with demand. 
131. Under its next generation safeguards initiative the United States was addressing international safeguards needs over the next 25 years and beyond. It was developing new techniques for characterizing nuclear materials, new approaches for monitoring nuclear facilities and new tools for integrated information analysis. It was recruiting and training a new generation of safeguards experts and expanding its efforts to help other countries pursue nuclear power safely and securely. It welcomed JapanÂs decision to host the second international conference on Next Generation Safeguards in October 2009. As decades of experience had shown, countries with peaceful activities and ambitions had nothing to fear from safeguards. However, countries that violated their international obligations must face serious consequences both in the Agency and in the Security Council. Failure to impose meaningful consequences jeopardized everything that had been achieved. That could not be allowed to happen. 
132. The Agency should continue to take the lead in achieving President ObamaÂs vision, set forth in Prague in April 2009, of a world without nuclear weapons. The United States had already begun taking concrete steps. It had dramatically reduced the number of nuclear weapons in its stockpile and had permanently removed more than 430 tons of fissile material from weapons use. It had blended down 113 tons of its HEU into reactor fuel, enough for about 2700 nuclear warheads. It was also building a new MOX fuel fabrication plant that would permanently and transparently eliminate at least 34 metric tons of surplus weapons plutonium while producing enough fuel to power one million homes for 50 years. Once the MOX fuel had been irradiated in nuclear reactors, the plutonium was no longer readily weapons usable. 
133. Furthermore, the United States had made progress in negotiating a new strategic arms reduction treaty with the Russian Federation, was actively pursuing its own ratification of the CTBT, and had finally reached agreement at the Conference on Disarmament to negotiate a fissile material cut-off treaty. It was time to make the concrete gains of recent years irreversible by making them part of a global, durable and verifiable ban on the production of fissile material for weapons. 
134. The Agency had a critical role to play in keeping nuclear weapons out of the hands of terrorists. It was known that terrorists would not hesitate to use a nuclear weapon, so the essential strategy had to be to prevent them from acquiring or producing one. As long as there was unsecured nuclear material around the world, all nations were at risk. In that regard, President Obama had set an ambitious but achievable goal of securing all vulnerable nuclear material around the world within four years. The United States was accelerating its efforts, but could not achieve that goal on its own. It was working with the Russian Federation and other countries to ensure that all fissile material, whether from civil or military programmes, was accounted for and secured against diversion or terrorist threats. One component of that effort was the conversion of civilian research reactors away from HEU. Over the past 12 months, the United States had worked with the Agency and its Member States to convert 7 reactors to use LEU fuel. Since 1996, it had have removed enough HEU fuel for nearly 100 nuclear weapons. 
135. It was necessary to work together to disrupt black market networks and stop transfers of dangerous materials, including radiological sources that could be used to make dirty bombs. The United States had worked with the Agency, the European Union and other partners to deploy more than 1000 radiation detection systems at seaports, airports, border crossings and other international transit points. The Agency was promoting best practices for nuclear security and providing transparency and accountability to the world community. The work of the new World Institute for Nuclear Security, which had the support of the Department of Energy, would complement the AgencyÂs efforts. To address those issues in a global forum, President Obama would be hosting an international nuclear security summit in Washington in April 2010, which would be an opportunity to reinforce commitments and advance national and international actions to secure nuclear materials and prevent nuclear terrorism. 
136. It was an important moment for the Agency and the world. The transition to a new Director General provided an opportunity to review the AgencyÂs priorities and needs. The United States was committed to working with the Agency and its Member States to place the Agency on a firm foundation for the future. It would help to provide the resources the Agency needed to remain a strong and effective partner in the common efforts. It wanted to help to bring Agency members together, to overcome lingering differences and achieve lasting progress towards the use of atoms for peace alone. 
137. Mr WANG Yiren (China) paid tribute to the outgoing Director General, Mr ElBaradei, and the contributions made by the Agency to the promotion of peaceful uses of nuclear energy and nuclear non-proliferation under his leadership. He also congratulated the incoming Director General, Mr Amano, on his nomination. 
138. At the International Ministerial Conference on Nuclear Energy in the 21st Century held in April 2009 in Beijing, ministers and high-ranking officials from all countries had gathered to share experiences and views and explore future strategies and ideas concerning the sustainable development of nuclear energy. There had been broad consensus that nuclear energy was a technically proven, clean, safe and economically competitive source of energy. Thus, the Conference had made a positive contribution to promoting the global renaissance and expansion of nuclear energy. 
139. The peaceful uses of nuclear energy in China were expanding rapidly. The existing 11 operational nuclear power units with an installed capacity of 9100 MW(e) would be complemented 
by a further 24 units approved for construction with a total capacity of 25.4 GW(e). In the framework of the medium-and long-term nuclear development plan (2005-2020), another 40 GW(e) of capacity would be installed, with a further 18 GW(e) under construction. China was also engaged in analysis and deliberations with a view to possibly expanding that medium-and long-term nuclear power target. 
140. After more than half a century, China had mastered the key technologies in uranium prospecting, mining, purification, conversion, enrichment and fuel element fabrication and had established a complete nuclear industrial system. It had the capacity to assure the requisite fuel supply for its nuclear energy development. Priority was being given to R&D of next generation technologies, including the China experimental fast reactor and the high-temperature gas-cooled reactor demonstration project. China was also actively participating in the GIF (Generation IV International Forum) and ITER (International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor) programmes. 
141. Nuclear safety was a precondition for the sustainable development of nuclear energy. China had acceded to the Convention on Nuclear Safety and the Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management. It had put in place a comprehensive legal and regulatory system for nuclear safety, established the National Nuclear Emergency Response Coordination Committee, and formulated national nuclear emergency plans. In addition, it had intensified research into critical technologies for radioactive waste management, including decommissioning of nuclear facilities, spent fuel reprocessing, treatment and disposal of radioactive waste, partitioning and transmutation. The strategy of regional near-surface disposal of low and intermediate level radioactive waste and deep geological disposal of high level and transuranium radioactive waste had been developed with a view to reducing the volume of radioactive waste and ensuring environmental safety. 
142. China, a long-standing opponent of nuclear proliferation and nuclear terrorism, had developed a complete nuclear material management and export control system. The country had participated in the amendment of the CPPNM and was about to deposit with the Agency its instrument of ratification of that amendment. 
143. Economic development, climate change and energy security were global issues that required international joint efforts. Despite the impact of the global financial crisis, global nuclear energy had grown steadily and there was a growing interest in nuclear power among developing Member States. The Iranian and North Korean nuclear issues remained pending, international calls for strengthening non-proliferation were increasing and new proposals were emerging for multilateral nuclear fuel cycle mechanisms. In response to the new situation, the Agency would have a more prominent role to play in a number of areas. 
144. Firstly, in the context of the global nuclear renaissance, many developing Member States looked to the Agency for support in promoting nuclear power and nuclear technology applications. In so doing, the Agency should ensure balance in its activities and ensure increased support for technical cooperation with adequate and assured funding. 
145. Secondly, the Agency should also focus on nuclear infrastructure development, which was of critical importance to new entrants to nuclear power. His delegation welcomed the increase in the number of technical cooperation projects in that field and the provision of Integrated Nuclear Infrastructure Review (INIR) services for newcomers. ChinaÂs technical cooperation project with the Agency on enhancing the capabilities of national institutions supporting nuclear power development was proceeding smoothly. Its successful implementation would boost domestic infrastructure development and human resource development, contribute to the sound expansion of ChinaÂs nuclear energy industry, set a model for other developing countries in the region and beyond, and facilitate training and assistance to other countries. 
146. Thirdly, the Agency should strengthen nuclear safety and security and prevent nuclear terrorism. It should continue its efforts to establish a global nuclear safety and security legal framework and international standards, increase exchanges of nuclear knowledge, experience and lessons learnt and disseminate a culture of nuclear safety with a view to increasing public confidence in nuclear energy development. China hoped to continue cooperation with the Agency to ensure nuclear security at the World Expo 2010 in Shanghai. 
147. Fourthly, the Agency should facilitate discussions on approaches to assured supply of nuclear fuel. Nuclear fuel supply was essential for nuclear energy development and a number of proposals on the development of multilateral nuclear fuel cycle mechanisms had been put forward in recent years. The establishment of such mechanisms carried certain benefits for the peaceful use of nuclear energy and the effective prevention of nuclear proliferation. Relevant issues should be addressed in a balanced and non-discriminatory manner. All parties concerned should continue discussing the political, legal and technical issues involved and seek a solution acceptable to all. 
148. Fifthly, the Agency should enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of safeguards. Its responsibilities relating to verification, efficient safeguards and ensuring the peaceful use of nuclear energy were an increasing challenge and progress was needed towards the universal application of comprehensive safeguards agreements and additional protocols. The Agency should improve its own technical capability and at the same time should strengthen cooperation with Member States by making full use of their resources in order to achieve safeguards objectives. China stood ready to support the AgencyÂs efforts to that end. 
149. Sixthly, the AgencyÂs efforts to resolve complex nuclear issues had been the focus of international attention. China had been consistently advocating peaceful solutions to the North Korean and Iranian nuclear issues through dialogue and negotiations and had made unremitting efforts in that regard. China would continue cooperating with all parties concerned to achieve the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and to find an appropriate solution to the Iranian nuclear issue with a view to safeguarding the international nuclear non-proliferation regime and maintaining regional peace and stability. The Agency should maintain its objectivity and impartiality and continue to play a constructive role. 
150. The rapid expansion of nuclear energy worldwide represented both a challenge and an opportunity for the Agency. The close cooperation and concerted efforts of Member States and the Secretariat would help the Agency fulfil its mission. 
151. Mr SALEHI (Islamic Republic of Iran) expressed the hope that the General Conference would address a number of issues, including the inalienable right of States to use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes, the enhancement of international peace and security through the eradication of weapons of mass destruction, the universal application of the comprehensive safeguards regime without prejudice or discrimination, the need to maintain a balance between the AgencyÂs promotional responsibilities and its verification activities, and the need for an internationally negotiated, legally binding instrument on assurances of nuclear fuel supply. Furthermore, it was important to recognize the threat posed to the AgencyÂs independence by the political pressure exerted on the Secretariat. 
152. Since the end of the second world war and the tragedies of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, nuclear energy and associated technologies had stood at a crossroads between the development of nuclear technology, on the one hand, and global and regional wrangling, on the other. Nuclear competition aimed at unilateral domination had resulted only in an ominous cold war, and although all traces of that time appeared to have disappeared, its defining authoritarianism and arrogance continued to hold sway. IranÂs courageous and almost single-handed attempts to challenge such arrogance had met only with affirmations by a number of States that they were defending their national interests. Under that 
pretext, those States had amassed a terrifying arsenal in the Persian Gulf tens of thousands of miles away from home. Meanwhile, IranÂs attempts to exercise its sovereign right were shamelessly denied. The continued threat of attack on IranÂs nuclear facilities had only strengthened its resolve. It had overcome an imposed war and unjust sanctions and emerged as one of the most advanced countries in the region. Iran had successfully launched a satellite, and had played a pioneering role in the cloning of sheep, cows and goats. It had one of the highest numbers of students per capita and had published more books than any other Muslim country. Iran took seriously the threats made against it and had every confidence in its capacity to defend itself. 
153. Iran was a peace-loving nation and viewed dialogue and unconditional negotiations as the key to conflict resolution. Iran had always rejected weapons of mass destruction and the non-peaceful uses of nuclear technology, and insisted on the integrity of the NPT and on global nuclear disarmament. The international community had witnessed IranÂs appeal for the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East. Unfortunately, Israel had failed to cooperate in that regard. It had not acceded to the NPT and it possessed a nuclear weapons programme. It constantly turned a deaf ear to international appeals for peace and security and refused the Agency access to its nuclear installations. Such arrogance would surely lead to unexpected consequences within the region. Iran, by contrast, had maintained strong and active ties with the Agency since its inception, and had even gone beyond the call of duty by implementing the additional protocol for over two and a half years in order to demonstrate transparency and a spirit of cooperation. Subsequently, Iran and the Agency had agreed on a work plan to establish a timescale for ending the AgencyÂs investigations of IranÂs nuclear activities, with a view to making safeguards implementation a routine process in Iran. He hoped that the Agency would keep its word and deliver on its commitments in accordance with the final paragraph of the work plan contained in document INFCIRC/711. Iran would not accept discriminatory treatment. 
154. With respect to IranÂs nuclear programme, he said his country now had considerable radioisotope production capacity. That capacity was expected to increase further once the heavy water reactor at Arak came into operation. Thereafter, Iran intended to meet the humanitarian needs of neighbouring countries by providing them with pharmaceutical radioisotopes. Also, Iran was prepared to share its experience of nuclear technology by hosting, in collaboration with the Agency, various regional and international workshops and training courses on nuclear applications in medicine, agriculture and industry. The production capacity at the uranium conversion facility in Isfahan could be made available to other countries on request, under the full supervision of the Agency. Iran was embarking on a long-term plan to construct nuclear power plants with a total capacity of 5000 MW(e) within the next decade. Such an ambitious project required comprehensive planning in various fields of nuclear technology, such as the fuel cycle, safety and waste management techniques. 
155. In the course of its peaceful nuclear activities, Iran remained committed to cooperating closely with the Agency in accordance with its safeguards agreement.

5. Mr MUSYOKA (Kenya) commended the outgoing Director General, Mr ElBaradei, on his excellent leadership of the Agency over the previous decade and congratulated the incoming Director General, Ambassador Amano, on his appointment and wished him every success in his task. 
6. Kenya strongly supported the right of all States to have full use of nuclear technology and scientific applications in accordance with the NPT, and reaffirmed the basic, inalienable right of all States, without discrimination, to use atomic energy for peaceful purposes. His country would be concluding a comprehensive safeguards agreement, additional protocol and a small quantities protocol in the near future, and intended to bring those instruments into force as soon as possible with a view to promoting the universalization of the NPT. 
7. The AgencyÂs technical cooperation activities in Kenya continued to contribute significantly to the GovernmentÂs efforts to develop the nuclear science and technology infrastructure. A draft Country Programme Framework for the period 2011Â2016, had been submitted to the Agency. In addition to the 12 national projects that were being implemented, Kenya was participating in 35 regional and interregional projects covering areas including human resources development, human health, agriculture and livestock production, industrial applications, energy planning, radiation protection and radioactive waste management. Furthermore, as a result of human capacity development and radiation detection equipment, KenyaÂs competent authority had enhanced its regulatory measures and had opened additional regional offices. Kenya would continue cooperating with the Agency with a view to maintaining the International Basic Safety Standards. 
8. He commended the Agency for its continued efforts to strengthen nuclear safety and security in the transport of radioactive sources and waste management. Kenya was at an advanced stage in installing radiation portal monitors at the main seaport of Mombasa to screen for illicit radioactive and nuclear materials. Collaboration with development partners had also assisted in the establishment of a continuous training programme for border personnel. 
9. Kenya had allocated US $7 million for the ongoing construction of a central radioactive waste processing facility, which would include an interim storage facility for disused conventional radiation sources and other radioactive materials. Development partners were invited to support the implementation of the project. 
10. Kenya was committed to pursuing the nuclear option to address its energy needs and had held an energy conference for stakeholders in October 2008 where nuclear energy had been recognized as a viable option in the countryÂs energy mix. It was seeking the AgencyÂs assistance for the development of nuclear power plants in order to generate an extra 1000 MW in the immediate future. 
11. In the field of nuclear science and applications, Kenya welcomed the high priority attached to agricultural and livestock development in Africa. Tsetse and trypanosomosis continued to pose a threat to Kenyan communities and were a constraint to livestock production. Kenya therefore welcomed the steps taken towards formalizing the collaborative framework in support of PATTEC. The release of test sterile male tsetse flies in the Lambwe Valley was underway with a view to establishing the first tsetse-free zone in Kenya under PATTEC. The mutation breeding technique was being extended to crops such as bananas and cassava, and he thanked all Member States and the specialized agencies involved for their contributions in that regard. 
12. With regard to PACT, Kenya commended the Agency for its role in establishing comprehensive cancer control programmes at six demonstration sites, one of which was in Africa, and for its intention to establish one more site in Africa. However, more demonstration sites should be set up, particularly in Africa, and Kenya would appreciate being earmarked for such a site. His country was grateful for the support it had been given for the radiotherapy services at the Kenyatta Hospital and the Nyanza General Hospital and looked forward to a continuing partnership in that regard. 
13. In view of the need to enhance skills development in the area of nuclear science and technology, the University of Nairobi was in the process of adopting a master of science programme in line with the AFRA harmonized syllabus. Kenya welcomed the AgencyÂs technical support in that connection. 
14. Partnership between Kenya and the Agency had resulted in the establishment of a secondary standards dosimetry laboratory. He appealed for support in order to equip the laboratory with a cobalt-60 calibration system. Kenya also sought support for the strengthening of human capacities and the provision of equipment to expand the application of radioisotope technology. 
15. The development of nuclear technology for peaceful applications should be considered as a matter of high priority since it could, in the long run, help to strengthen the socio-economic development of developing countries. Having emphasized the importance of the AgencyÂs technical cooperation programme, he said that his Government pledged its full share of the TCF target for 2010. 
16. Mr YOUNIS (Egypt) said that during Mr ElBaradeiÂs tenure as Director General, the Agency had achieved major advances in all areas of its mandate. Egypt was proud that the AgencyÂs performance over the past 12 years under the leadership of one of its nationals had led to the award of the Nobel Peace Prize to the Agency and Mr ElBaradei. He also assured the incoming Director General, Mr Yukiya Amano, of EgyptÂs full support. 
17. It was now more than half a century since Egypt had recognized the potential of nuclear energy and its applications for economic and social development and for environmental protection if properly 
used. Over the years it had cooperated closely with the Agency in expanding peaceful uses of nuclear energy in Egypt. It had benefited from technical cooperation projects in areas such as the training of human resources to ensure the optimum operation and use of the countryÂs research reactors. The Agency continued to assist Egypt in supporting food security through gamma irradiation for the production of high-yield crop mutants, applying nuclear techniques to the cultivation of desert land, developing plant varieties that were adapted to desert conditions, and using radiation processed hydrogels for agricultural applications because of their high capacity to absorb water and hence to enhance water retention by sandy soil. 
18. Studies of the impact of climate change were required to obtain accurate information for decision-making on the sustainable management of water resources. The Agency had assisted the countries of the Nile Basin, including Egypt, in improving understanding of groundwater behaviour with a view to its rational management. Egypt was also involved in Agency projects based on the use of isotope techniques. 
19. In October 2007 President Mubarak had announced that a strategic decision had been taken to build a number of nuclear power plants and that the first one would be built in cooperation with international partners and the Agency. He had instructed the Government to elaborate an integrated national strategy focusing on renewable energy sources and peaceful uses of nuclear energy. The Agency had assisted in training the necessary human resources and establishing the requisite infrastructure. A draft law regulating the countryÂs nuclear and radiological activities had been reviewed by Agency experts and would shortly be enacted and, in June 2009, an international company had been hired to provide consultancy services in connection with the building of the first nuclear plant. Egypt would continue to cooperate with the Agency to ensure transparency and in the short term would seek its assistance in completing studies concerning site selection, basic operational steps and training of human resources. 
20. As a State belonging to the Arab region and the African continent, Egypt had opened up its facilities and laboratories and shared its expertise relating to peaceful uses of nuclear energy with other Arab and African States. It supported AFRA projects, which made a tangible contribution to the economic and social development of the peoples of the African continent and helped to alleviate their sufferings. 
21. Egypt supported the AgencyÂs safeguards and verification activities and emphasized the need to develop arrangements for apportioning the increasing costs of safeguards applications in such a way that States with advanced nuclear programmes made appropriate contributions. The wide gap between the funding of technical cooperation activities, on the one hand, and safeguards, on the other, despite their equal importance as pillars of the AgencyÂs work, raised serious questions regarding priorities and balance in pursuit of the AgencyÂs goals, especially since developing States were required to contribute to the funding of technical cooperation projects. 
22. Egypt continued to be concerned about a serious shortcoming in the existing safeguards regime, namely that comprehensive safeguards were not applicable to States that had not acceded to the NPT. Moreover, no serious steps were taken to monitor the five nuclear weapon StatesÂ compliance with their disarmament obligations under Article VI of the NPT. The basic aim of the safeguards regime was to promote the universality of the NPT and the application of comprehensive safeguards to all nuclear facilities in every State of the world. 
23. Egypt also noted the ongoing attempts to universalize the additional protocol and turn it into the current standard for verification of the non-existence of undeclared nuclear activities. It stressed that the additional protocol was a voluntary instrument and that its implementation depended on a 
sovereign decision of the State concerned. No attempt should be made to universalize it until comprehensive safeguards agreements had been universalized. 
24. Egypt was concerned about the AgencyÂs continued failure to support the international community in its aim of bringing about nuclear disarmament, although one of the goals contained in the Medium Term Strategy for 2006-2011 was that the Agency should contribute as appropriate to effective verification of nuclear arms control and reduction agreements, including nuclear disarmament, in conformity with Article II of the Statute. He urged all Member States to take serious steps to address the issue. 
25. The current situation of the NPT and disarmament regime in the Middle East presented a serious threat to regional and international peace and security. Although 17 years had passed since the General Conference had first adopted a resolution calling on all States in the Middle East to apply comprehensive safeguards, Israel had taken no steps to implement the resolution and the major powers had failed to react. Egypt and all other States in the region were party to the NPT. The anomalous situation was driving the entire region into an arms race, since the fact that only one State possessed a huge destructive arsenal entitled the other States to seek some means of countering the threat. 
26. The AgencyÂs credibility depended to a large extent on the seriousness with which its Members addressed the issue of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East and the application of comprehensive safeguards to all nuclear installations in the region. The General Conference should reaffirm the AgencyÂs commitment to address the nuclear threat in the Middle East by discussing the draft resolutions submitted under the relevant agenda items in a fair and balanced way. 
27. Egypt would again submit a draft resolution concerning the application of safeguards in the Middle East. The consensus thereon had been broken for the past three sessions on non-objective grounds and the draft resolution had been linked to legitimate Arab attempts to have the Conference adopt a resolution on Israeli nuclear capabilities. Egypt had amended the text of the draft resolution on the application of safeguards in the Middle East in the light of some of the observations and suggestions made, hoping thereby to secure a consensus once again. 
28. Mr KIRIENKO (Russian Federation) commended outgoing Director General ElBaradei, whose efforts and successes over the previous 12 years had received worldwide recognition. He congratulated incoming Director General Amano on his appointment and assured him of RussiaÂs full support. 
29. For over half a century, the Agency had been recognized as the international centre for cooperation in the nuclear field. In the light of the new challenges and threats facing the world community, the AgencyÂs role as the only international organization ensuring the necessary balance between the peaceful use of atomic energy and compliance with nuclear non-proliferation standards was increasing. 
30. The development of nuclear power in close cooperation with the Agency was one of the priorities Russia had identified for the modernization and technological development of its economy. Specific projects included the further improvement of WWER technology and the development of infrastructure for a new technological platform for atomic energy based on fast reactors and closure of the fuel cycle. Using its experience in the area of sodium cooled fast reactors, Russia was building a high power fast reactor and manufacturing mixed oxide (MOX) fuel. Work to master controlled fusion was continuing and Russia was one of the ten countries involved in the ITER (International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor) project at Cadarache, France. 
31. At the same time, Russia attached importance to the development of fundamental science, and was involved in establishment of the international Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research at 
Darmstadt. In July 2009, his Government had decided to sign the Framework Agreement for International Collaboration on Research and Development of Generation IV Nuclear Energy Systems. 
32. The number of intergovernmental agreements signed by the Russian Federation on cooperation in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy was increasing. In the previous two years alone, Russia had concluded some 40 international agreements and in 2009 with Japan, Jordan, Belarus, Nigeria, Turkey and Mongolia. Two light water reactors had been constructed in China with support from the Russian Federation; two units were under construction in India and agreement had been reached for the construction of a further four units; the building of a nuclear power plant in Iran was nearing completion, and the construction of two units in Bulgaria had begun. The Baltic nuclear power plant project in Kaliningrad was an integrated international project that would address not only Russian but also European energy issues. Russia looked forward to transparent and mutually beneficial cooperation with its foreign partners in all areas of the peaceful utilization of atomic energy, in strict compliance with all international legal norms. 
33. Given the growing role played by nuclear power and the introduction of new industrial and power generation capacity in the nuclear area, the AgencyÂs monitoring and verification activities would increase. The technical means available to the Agency in that regard should correspond with the increase in the number of facilities subject to safeguards. Russia welcomed the AgencyÂs efforts to implement integrated safeguards and would continue to promote the further strengthening of the safeguards system by financing the national safeguards support programme. 
34. Much was being done to prevent nuclear weapons and materials from falling into the hands of terrorists and, in that connection, he drew attention to the efforts of the Agency to strengthen the nuclear security regime worldwide. Russia supported the implementation of the AgencyÂs Nuclear Security Plan for 2006Â2009 and the new Plan for 2010Â2013. His Government was planning to make an extrabudgetary contribution of $1.5 million to the Nuclear Security Fund in 2010, and $1 million annually between 2011 and 2015. 
35. Russia attached importance to the AgencyÂs technical cooperation activities and intended to pay in full its voluntary contribution to the TCF. In 2008, it had contributed a further 240 million roubles to the project on improving the design safety of the Armenian nuclear power plant. 
36. His country strove to meet the highest safety regulation levels for the use of nuclear power in accordance with international conventions and Agency recommendations. In 2009, Russia would for the first time host an Agency mission to evaluate the activities of the regulatory authorities. 
37. The Russian Federation intended to assist Ukraine in enhancing safety at the site of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant and in expediting the plantÂs decommissioning. To that end, it would be paying $10 million into the EBRDÂs Nuclear Safety Account and $7 million into the Chernobyl Shelter Fund. 
38. The work to return to the Russian Federation HEU from research reactors of Soviet design and construction was continuing. As of 1 September 2009, more than 470 kg of fresh HEU from 12 countries had been returned to Russia, as well as 415 kg of spent HEU from Romania, Latvia, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Uzbekistan, Hungary and Kazakhstan. In 2009, intergovernmental agreements had been signed with Romania, Serbia and Poland. That very day, 500 kg of spent HEU fuel Â theoretically sufficient for 7Â8 nuclear weapons Â had arrived at a Russian port from a research reactor in Poland for conversion into LEU. Moreover, the following day a contract would be signed in Vienna for the return to Russia of spent nuclear fuel from the Vin?a research reactor in Serbia. 
39. Russia was continuing its efforts in the area of non-proliferation. In 2008, it had shutdown two plutonium-producing reactors, and another one was planned for spring 2010. In accordance with the HEU-LEU agreement, Russia would be destroying 500 tonnes of weapons-grade uranium by 31 December 2013, of which some 370 tonnes of uranium enriched to more than 90% had already been downblended. 
40. The development of nuclear power in many countries raised the question about the assured supply of nuclear fuel. From an economic point of view, building the capacity to fabricate nuclear fuel was an extremely costly process. The problem could most effectively be resolved with the Agency playing a central role with respect to multilateral approaches to the fuel cycle. Russia would continue to support the AgencyÂs activities, and would work with other interested countries to that end. 
41. The 2007 Russian initiative to establish, together with Kazakhstan, an International Uranium Enrichment Centre (IUEC) at the Angarsk Electrolysis Chemical Complex was continuing and in 2008 the Enrichment Centre had been granted all the required licences and authorizations. Armenia had joined in 2009 and Russia had received notice from Ukraine about its intention to join. 
42. Work was continuing on building up an LEU stockpile of two 1000 MW reactor loads with the AgencyÂs agreement, to be kept at the IUEC. At the March and June 2009 meetings of the Board of Governors, Russia had put forward its own initiative to establish a reserve of LEU for the supply of LEU to the Agency for its Member States. That initiative, based on Article IX of the Statute, did not infringe the rights of Member States to develop their own manufacturing capacities concerning the nuclear fuel cycle, and did not impose any conditions. An assured supply met the concerns of those who did not want to make themselves entirely dependent on the political situation. The Russian proposal was independent and did not go against, or compete with, other initiatives that had been put forward. 
43. INPRO was a good example of successful international cooperation. Following the publication, at the end of 2008, of the INPRO methodology for innovative nuclear energy system assessment, the second phase of the project was now in progress. Russia appreciated the AgencyÂs budgetary support for INPRO and called on all INPRO participants to share in its direct financing. For its part, the Russian Federation would contribute 23 million roubles to INPRO each year from 2008 to 2012. 
44. Ms KARLSSON (Sweden), speaking on behalf of the European Union, the candidate countries the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Croatia, the countries of the Stabilisation and Association process and potential candidates Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro, the EFTA countries Iceland and Norway, members of the European Economic Area, as well as the Republic of Moldova and Ukraine that associated themselves with the statement, congratulated the incoming Director General on his election. The European Union was deeply grateful to the outgoing Director General for his outstanding performance and leadership. 
45. Recalling the AgencyÂs ÂAtoms for PeaceÂ mandate and drawing attention to current challenges in the area of nuclear proliferation and compliance, she said that the European Union was fully committed to the NPT as the cornerstone of the global nuclear non-proliferation regime and the essential foundation for the pursuit of nuclear disarmament and the development of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. 
46. The outcome of the third session of the Preparatory Committee for the 2010 NPT Review Conference was encouraging. The European Union had presented a set of forward-looking proposals on all three pillars of the NPT for possible inclusion in an action plan to be adopted by the Review Conference. 
47. The European Union reaffirmed the competence of the Security Council, as the final arbiter of international peace and security, to take appropriate action in the event of non-compliance with NPT obligations, including safeguards agreements. As an essential part of the global nuclear non-proliferation regime, the AgencyÂs comprehensive safeguards agreements, together with additional protocols, constituted the current Agency verification standard and all States that had not done so should bring into force safeguards agreements without delay and sign, ratify and implement an additional protocol. 
48. The fact that, after six years of intensive efforts and despite some progress made, the Agency was still unable to give assurances as to the exclusively peaceful nature of the nuclear activities of the Islamic Republic of Iran was cause for serious concern. Iran must comply with all relevant Security Council and Agency Board of Governors resolutions and restore confidence in the peaceful nature of its nuclear activities. The ratification and prompt implementation by Iran of the additional protocol it had already signed would be an important step in that direction. 
49. While the international community recognized IranÂs right to develop and use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes, it needed to be sure that it complied with its NPT non-proliferation obligations. The fact that Iran continued to block substantial cooperation with the Agency and refused to answer a long list of outstanding questions was deplorable. Iran should comply fully with all its international obligations, including implementation of the revised Code 3.1 of the Subsidiary Arrangements General Part, and give the Agency continued and complete access to the Arak heavy water reactor in order to enable design information verification. She commended the Director General and the Secretariat for their impartial efforts in that regard and urged Iran to cooperate in a transparent manner. Furthermore, it urged Iran to engage in talks to find a negotiated solution to the current crisis and take up the invitation by China, France, Germany, the Russian Federation, the United Kingdom and the United States of America in that regard. 
50. The European Union was seriously concerned over the developments in the DPRK. Provocative actions, such as the nuclear test announced in May 2009 and the recent statement about uranium enrichment and plutonium weaponization, undermined regional stability and represented a threat to international peace and security. She urged the DPRK to return by the six-party talks immediately and without preconditions. The DPRK should abandon and completely dismantle any nuclear weapons related programme in a prompt, transparent, verifiable and irreversible manner and comply with all international obligations fully, unconditionally and without delay. Taking note of the Director GeneralÂs report on the application of safeguards in the DPRK of 30 July 2009, contained in document GC(53)/13, she said it was regrettable that the DPRK had prevented the Agency from implementing its ad hoc monitoring and verification activities since April 2009 and urged the DPRK to allow the Agency to resume its work. The European Union called for international cooperation in resolving the crisis and for the prompt and universal implementation of Security Council resolution 1874 (2009). 
51. The European Union remained unconvinced of the completeness and correctness of the declarations by the Syrian Arab Republic under its comprehensive safeguards agreement. Syria should provide the Agency with full information, supporting documentation and access to all relevant sites. It should also sign and ratify the additional protocol as soon as possible so as to strengthen international confidence in the peaceful nature of its nuclear activities. 
52. A major challenge for the Agency was to respond to the increased interest in nuclear energy in several countries, triggered by concerns linked to the security of energy supplies and to climate change. All countries had the right to define its own energy strategy and the Agency played a key role in assisting States new to nuclear energy to ensure the legal, safe, secure and proliferation-resistant use of nuclear power. The establishment of the Integrated Nuclear Infrastructure Review (INIR) was a useful development in that regard. 
53. The European Union attached importance to a high level of nuclear safety worldwide. International cooperation and adoption of the relevant international conventions were vital in that context. Cooperation with the Agency was also crucial as the AgencyÂs comprehensive set of safety standards were fundamental. Member States that had not done so should accede to the relevant safety conventions without delay. The European Union supported the AgencyÂs efforts to strengthen the global nuclear safety framework and had dedicated some Â570 million for the period 2007-2013 for that purpose. 
54. The Council Directive establishing a Community framework for the nuclear safety of nuclear installations adopted in June 2009 set out obligations for Member States that built on those established under the AgencyÂs Convention on Nuclear Safety and the Safety Fundamentals. It required Member States to establish and maintain a national nuclear safety framework; it enhanced the role and independence of national regulatory authorities; it confirmed that the primary responsibility for nuclear safety rested with license holders; and it required a high level of transparency and regular independent safety assessments. Thus, the European Union had become the first region in the world to give binding legal force to key aspects of international nuclear safety standards. The European Nuclear Safety Regulator Groups (ENSREG) would continue its efforts to strengthen nuclear safety in the region. 
55. She commended the Agency for its work to prevent and combat nuclear terrorism, including the steps taken to fund nuclear security activities through the Regular Budget. The European Union strategy against the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction supported those efforts at the regional level. The Union was among the main contributors to the Nuclear Security Fund and had earmarked Â300 million for chemical, biological, nuclear and radiological risk mitigation in third countries under its new Instrument for Stability. She welcomed the newly adopted Nuclear Security Plan for 2010Â 2013 and called on all Member States to give financial or in-kind support to the Nuclear Security Fund in order to facilitate implementation of the Plan. 
56. Closer cooperation was required among governments, international organizations and such initiatives as the Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism (GICNT) and the World Institute for Nuclear Security (WINS), to prevent and respond to nuclear and radiological terrorism. Further initiatives might be needed. The European Union welcomed the high-level summit on global nuclear security scheduled for March 2010, which should send a positive signal to the 2010 NPT Review Conference. 
57. In the area of nuclear technology, the Agency should continue to pursue programmes aimed at improving safety, non-proliferation and waste management and projects assisting interested countries in applying nuclear technology in the areas of health and research. Continued support must be provided to research on the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. Safety, waste management, radiation protection, and the safety and efficiency of advanced technology, as well as international cooperation in those fields relied on competence and know-how across the nuclear sector. 
58. The AgencyÂs technical cooperation programme was of vital importance, especially for developing countries. Nuclear applications for treating diseases, making crops resistant to disease, increasing crop yields, insect pest control and improved livestock were impressive examples. The European Union was a major contributor of the programme, which relied on sufficient financial resources. All States, including beneficiaries, should contribute to it. Governments should prove their commitment to projects by putting in place the necessary infrastructure. She noted with concern the decline in the rate of implementation of the technical cooperation programme in recent years. 
59. The European Union remained firmly convinced of the potential benefits of multilateral approaches to the nuclear fuel cycle, supported the establishment of an LEU bank under Agency 
supervision, and would contribute up to Â25 million to the project once the conditions and modalities had been approved by the Board of Governors. 
60. Other initiatives on multilateral mechanisms, which could provide back-up mechanisms to interested countries while the market was functioning well, included GermanyÂs Multilateral Enrichment Sanctuary Project (MESP), the United KingdomÂs Nuclear Fuel Assurance and the multilateralization of the nuclear fuel cycle by Austria. The Board of GovernorÂs debate on assurance of supply had revealed different views on the implementation of existing proposals. Constructive answers to the questions and doubts expressed could and should be found and she invited all interested parties to engage in further dialogue and consultation to achieve a satisfactory outcome. 
61. Governance was another major challenge facing the Agency. Member States had high expectations with regard to defining the long term strategy, reconciling objectives and resources and striving for management excellence. European Union Member States were participating actively in discussions on the future of the Agency and were encouraged by the developments in that area. 
62. Mr OMER (Sudan) commended the Director General, Mr ElBaradei, on his indefatigable support during his tenure for the right of States to benefit from peaceful applications of nuclear energy in all areas. He also assured the incoming Director General, Mr Yukiya Amano, of SudanÂs staunch support. 
63. Sudan was fully committed to the fulfilment of all its obligations under the relevant international instruments that it had ratified. It urged other parties that had acceded to those instruments to ratify them speedily in order to foster a climate conducive to peace and sustainable development. Sudan was also in the process of ratifying the Pelindaba Treaty on a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Africa. 
64. Sudan supported the AgencyÂs efforts to enhance the safety and security of radiation sources. It was currently drafting a law on atomic energy based on the AgencyÂs guidelines. The law would make a clear separation of the regulatory authority from the various users of radiation. A single authority would monitor all radiation practices and would be empowered to discharge its mandate effectively and efficiently. 
65. Sudan had conducted a successful trial in using mobile hot cells in the disposal of spent radioactive sources of categories 1, 2 and 3, and to condition the sources so that they could be safely stored. He thanked the Agency and South Africa for their valuable assistance in ensuring the success of the experiment. 
66. Sudan was keenly interested in using nuclear power for electricity generation and trusted that the Agency would support its plans in that regard. The Ministry of Energy and Mining had established a national commission to prepare the necessary studies and to propose appropriate arrangements for the use of nuclear energy to generate electricity in Sudan. A special unit to implement the project had been set up in the Ministry, and a national strategy for building a power reactor and training the necessary human resources had been elaborated. Sudan was cooperating with the Agency on the building of a research reactor for the purpose. 
67. Sudan appreciated the AgencyÂs growing support for technical cooperation activities, especially those pertaining to nuclear science and technology and their applications. There was an urgent need for joint action to boost the AgencyÂs programmes in the area of water management, production of drinking water using small and medium sized reactors, and PACT, and to support the African Union campaign to eradicate the tsetse fly and all the AgencyÂs activities aimed at developing innovative nuclear technology. 
68. He was pleased to announce that Sudan had completed the drafting of its Country Programme Framework for the period 2009Â2013 and that it would be signed during the General Conference. 
69. The AFRA agreement could boast many achievements in the areas of food security, health care and the development of human resources. AFRA also helped to implement regional projects supported by the Agency. He hoped for continued cooperation and coordination in that regard. 
70. Sudan drew the attention of the Agency and all its Member States to the need to allocate more financial resources to the technical cooperation programme, which was no less important than the AgencyÂs other programmes concerning safeguards, verification and disarmament. He welcomed the statement in the Annual Report that greater balance would be sought between the AgencyÂs various activities, depending on the circumstances and on Member StatesÂ aspirations to develop their capacity for peaceful applications of nuclear energy. 
71. While Sudan commended the AgencyÂs role in promoting international peace and security, it urged the international community to pursue policies based on justice and equality and to refrain from applying double standards. In that context, he reaffirmed the principle that all States without exception were entitled to obtain and develop nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. That right could not be curtailed or treated as a bargaining chip under any circumstances. Sudan firmly believed in the importance of the AgencyÂs role under its Statute in developing international cooperation in the area of nuclear energy in accordance with its Member StatesÂ priorities. 
72. Everyone was aware of the risk of nuclear proliferation in the Middle East. The Arab States were deeply concerned about IsraelÂs nuclear programmes, which were not subject to Agency safeguards and which posed a major threat to peace and security in the region. His delegation called on Israel to accede forthwith to the NPT and to place all its nuclear installations under Agency safeguards. 
73. Sudan commended the Syrian Arab Republic on its continued cooperation with the Agency in the interests of ensuring closure of its file. It condemned the IsraelÂs military attack on the Dair Alzour facility, which constituted a flagrant breach of the Charter of the United Nations and of international legal norms. 
74. Sudan supported efforts to pursue constructive dialogue with the Islamic Republic of Iran in order to reach a fair closure of the case. It reaffirmed StatesÂ right to develop their national capabilities to strengthen the peaceful use of nuclear energy. 
75. The whole world feared and sought to contain nuclear proliferation. But there was, in his view, an even greater danger: a concept of science that was associated with the city of Vienna in which the General Conference was being held. The philosopher Ernst Mach, a member of the Vienna Circle, had defined science as essentially the description of experience. The inductive science movement that Mach represented rejected everything that was not ascertainable through experience. It was also known as logical positivism, a school of scientific thought that divorced science from metaphysics, ethics and religion. 
76. In support of their approach to science, they had invented the concept of verifiability, while their rivals had espoused that of falsifiability. A group headed by Rudolf Carnap had been a leading proponent of inductive logic and Carl Hempel had subscribed to the deductive-nomothetic model. They had all focused on developing an independent scientific order that was divorced from metaphysics, ethics and religion and relied solely on experience, mathematics, logic and perhaps language. The positivists had given up searching for the truth and had opted instead for conjectural analysis. As they were prominent scientists and philosophers, social scientists and students of ethics 
had begun to follow the same path. It was a paradigm under whose shadow people were still living today. 
77. Yet the importance of ethics and religion was now crystal clear. The liars and corrupt students of inductive logic, who had cast off all religious and moral constraints and whose scientific system was based on conjecture rather than on truth, had destroyed entire countries in some cases, expunged reality in others, and spoken with forked tongues about nuclear proliferation. 
78. It was time for the Agency to take action not only against nuclear proliferation but also in favour of a scientific order based on truth rather than conjecture. It was time to replace the school of thought led by Mach and the Vienna Circle with the quest for truth. As the Agency needed to base its important message on ethics and morals, the bodies it established to offer advice or assistance and to organize inspections should perhaps be composed not only of natural scientists but also of social scientists and even religious scholars. The only way of combating the evils of science and benefiting from its achievements was by integrating it into a deeper and broader system that linked heaven and earth and was based on truth and harmony. 
79. Mr HÃNIG (Hungary) having congratulated the President on her election, expressed appreciation for the efforts and achievements of the outgoing Director General, Mr ElBaradei, and congratulated his successor, Mr Amano. 
80. The AgencyÂs work and the NPT were at the heart of the nuclear non-proliferation regime. The AgencyÂs safeguards system had played a key role in international efforts to meet the challenges of proliferation. To that end, Hungary urged all Member States to ratify and implement a comprehensive safeguards agreement and an additional protocol. 
81. With regard to current proliferation challenges, his country joined the international community in condemning the recent underground nuclear test explosion in the DPRK. Another concern was the Islamic Republic of IranÂs continued refusal to fulfil all its obligations under relevant Security Council resolutions and to show transparency in clarifying remaining doubts about the true nature of its nuclear programme. Hungary supported the efforts of the international community to find a diplomatic solution to the issue. 
82. The AgencyÂs ever-growing challenges now included the nuclear renaissance as more and more countries declared their intention to embark on nuclear power programmes. His own Government had passed a decision paving the way, through the preparation of an environmental assessment and a study of energy markets and needs, for expansion of the Paks nuclear power plant. In addition, the Hungarian Atomic Energy Authority had decided that it was feasible to extend the life of the existing four units at the plant. 
83. HungaryÂs report to the Third Review Meeting of the Joint Convention had been well received, with some of its field activities being hailed as best practice. He called upon all Member States which had not yet done so to accede to the Joint Convention. 
84. With regard to progress on HungaryÂs national radioactive waste repository to store low level and intermediate level waste from the Paks nuclear power plant, he reported that the above-surface facility had been completed in 2008 and the first underground disposal chambers should be ready by late 2010. Another achievement in radioactive waste management was that a consignment of highly enriched spent fuel from the Budapest research reactor had been returned to its country of origin in 2008. He thanked the Agency and the generous supporters of the programme for their assistance with that project. 
85. An audit of the Hungarian National Institute of Oncology by the AgencyÂs Quality Assurance Team for Radiation Oncology (QUATRO) had shown that significant updating of equipment was 
required. Following the teamÂs recommendations, a new irradiation laboratory had now been installed. It was hoped that, after the planned second phase of upgrading, the Institute would qualify as an internationally accepted reference institute. 
86. In 2008, Hungary had participated in a regional project to analyse samples of Danube river water using isotope measurement techniques in order to determine water quality and areas of pollution. A new regional project to follow up on that success was being proposed for the next technical cooperation cycle. In future Hungary wished to continue its participation in technical cooperation activities as a beneficiary and also, to reciprocate the goodwill it had experienced in previous years, as a provider of experts and expertise to share its accumulated knowledge. In conclusion, he said that his country was continuing to provide training in the field of safeguards inspection under its safeguards support programme. 
87. Mr BOUOUNY (Tunisia) commended the Director General, Mr ElBaradei, on his outstanding performance during his tenure and on his determination to maintain the AgencyÂs independence and enhance its role in all the areas covered by its mandate. He was also confident that the incoming Director General, Mr Yukiya Amano, would address the many challenges facing the Agency with the requisite impartiality and professionalism. 
88. Tunisia attached great importance to nuclear energy and technology, especially their applications in areas such as electricity generation at a reasonable cost, promotion of food security, boosting of agricultural output and the production of safe drinking water while preserving the environment. His country had launched studies aimed at building a nuclear plant for electricity generation in cooperation with the Agency some decades previously and hoped to finalize the project by 2020. All data produced to date by the feasibility study confirmed that the project would produce major economic returns and would serve the national interest. 
89. Tunisia was aware of the importance of ensuring safe management and strict supervision of nuclear reactors, guaranteeing compliance with the technical and legal standards and norms pertaining to the international safeguards regime, providing for the safety and security of radioactive sources and for transport and waste safety, bearing in mind the risks of nuclear terrorism, and of establishing a civil liability regime for nuclear damage based on recognized international standards. 
90. Tunisia was currently preparing a programme aimed at developing human resources, supporting regulatory activities, which would be kept separate from the provision of services, and establishing a national nuclear safety authority. There were also plans to establish a national nuclear energy agency to promote different applications of nuclear energy, in particular the planned electricity generation plant. A legal and supervisory regime based on international standards was also being designed to ensure compliance with relevant obligations. It was hoped to finalize the basic components of the regime within a reasonably short period and to begin implementing it after reviewing its content either with the Agency or in the context of bilateral cooperation arrangements. 
91. Tunisia had recently taken steps to ratify the Convention on Nuclear Safety, the amendment to the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material, the Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism and the amendment to Article VI of the AgencyÂs Statute. The ratification procedure was likely to be completed before the end of 2009. Other relevant international instruments would be ratified as soon as the requisite legal and practical framework for their implementation had been established. 
92. Tunisia had signed its Country Programme Framework for 2008Â2012 at the beginning of 2009. It hoped that it would lead to further productive cooperation with the Agency on priority projects. During the current year the Agency had funded 18 national projects. In addition, Tunisia had participated in the implementation of 44 regional projects in Africa and 3 interregional projects. 
93. His country had pledged its share of the target contribution for 2010 to the TCF. It had also taken steps to pay all other amounts due to the Agency, including almost all of its outstanding contributions in respect of technical cooperation projects under the old system. He called on other Member States to pay their contributions to the AgencyÂs budget within reasonable time limits so that it could implement its programmes under the best possible circumstances. 
94. Tunisia hosted the Arab Atomic Energy Agency, which espoused the same goals as the International Atomic Energy Agency and fostered close cooperation among Arab States in pursuit of those goals and of their joint interests. At their summit in Doha in 2009, the Arab leaders had reaffirmed the right of Arab States to use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes and had adopted an Arab nuclear energy strategy covering the period until 2020. The Arab Atomic Energy Agency would begin to implement the strategy in 2010. He reaffirmed the importance of the cooperation agreement (INFCIRC/25/Add.6) concluded between the two Agencies in 1990 and emphasized the desirability of stepping up cooperation and implementing joint projects. 
95. Tunisia supported all initiatives aimed at nuclear disarmament. It was regrettable, however, that despite repeated calls for the creation of a zone free of weapons of mass destruction, particularly nuclear weapons, in the Middle East, that important goal had not yet been achieved. It would remain unattainable until comprehensive safeguards agreements were implemented by all States in the region without exception and all nuclear installations were placed under Agency safeguards. 
96. Mr PRODAN (Ukraine) said that his country supported the AgencyÂs efforts to strengthen cooperation among States in preserving knowledge and experience in nuclear energy, nuclear safety and the enhancement of regulatory capacities. It also fully supported the AgencyÂs efforts as regards preventing the proliferation of nuclear weapons and implementing safeguards. Ukraine, which fulfilled rigorously its international obligations under its safeguards agreement and additional protocol, reiterated its firm position that the AgencyÂs priority should be to universalize comprehensive safeguards. Implementation of Agency safeguards in countries conducting intensive nuclear activities required the AgencyÂs particular attention. 
97. Ukraine shared the international communityÂs deep concern over recent developments in the DPRK. It appealed to Pyongyang to fulfil its existing commitments fully and without delay and to abide by the relevant resolutions of the General Conference and the Security Council. While acknowledging IranÂs right to use nuclear energy peacefully, Ukraine supported the AgencyÂs efforts to provide assurances about the peaceful nature of IranÂs nuclear programme. IranÂs transparent and prompt cooperation with the Agency was essential in order to close the Iranian nuclear dossier. The investigation of the Syrian nuclear issue required that all the Member States involved cooperate actively within the framework of the Agency. 
98. Ukraine called upon all Member States to do their utmost to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons and the diversion of nuclear technologies for military purposes. Ukraine took positive note of the AgencyÂs assistance to governments in meeting their international non-proliferation obligations, particularly under Security Council resolutions 1540 (2004) and 1673 (2006). In view of the increasing threat of nuclear proliferation, Ukraine supported calls for an early start of negotiations on a fissile material cut-off treaty. His country greatly appreciated the AgencyÂs efforts to prevent illicit trafficking in nuclear and radioactive materials and its position in favour of strengthening the security regime for nuclear materials. For its part, Ukraine was actively implementing the Code of Conduct on the Safety and Security of Radioactive Sources and he announced that it would also follow the Guidance on the Import and Export of Radioactive Sources. More extensive international cooperation was needed to reduce the global threat of terrorism involving nuclear and radioactive materials. In that connection, his Parliament had ratified the amendment to the Convention on the Physical Protection of 
Nuclear Material in 2009, and he called on other States which had not yet done so to ratify the Amendment without delay. 
99. Safety performance indicators for Ukrainian nuclear power plants had remained at a high level, in keeping with national and international standards. With the AgencyÂs assistance, Ukraine was continuing to improve its relevant domestic legislation and to strengthen the capacities of its national regulatory body. He underscored the progress made in implementing the European Commission-IAEA-Ukraine joint project on safety evaluation of Ukrainian nuclear power plants under the memorandum of understanding on cooperation in the field of energy between the European Commission and Ukraine. The AgencyÂs missions were a further efficient tool for enhancing the security and safety of UkraineÂs operating nuclear facilities. In addition, he was glad to report that Kiev had hosted the 15th annual international forum of heads of regulatory authorities of countries operating WWER-type reactors. 
100. Ukraine took a positive view of the International Ministerial Conference on Nuclear Energy in the 21st Century held in Beijing under the AgencyÂs auspices, which, inter alia, had addressed the issue of establishing a global nuclear safety network. He commended the AgencyÂs Response Assistance Network and its Incident and Emergency Centre and said that Ukraine considered it a positive development that 23 countries, including Ukraine, had already joined the Illicit Trafficking Database. 
101. Equally important were the AgencyÂs activities with respect to radiation safety and radioactive waste management. In its national report under the Joint Convention, Ukraine had clearly demonstrated that it had been using the right methods and was maintaining a high level of safety in that area. Ukraine called on the States that had not yet done so to accede to the Joint Convention without delay. In 2009, Ukraine had adopted a national strategy for radioactive waste management up until 2059, which would ensure the safe management of radioactive waste while incorporating international best practices. In addition, Ukraine was successfully implementing its national nuclear security plan for 2006-2009. 
102. Ukraine took note of the AgencyÂs progress in the critical area of efforts to strengthen partnerships with governmental and non-governmental organizations and others in order to attract additional resources and enhance efficiency in carrying out the AgencyÂs statutory mandate. 
103. In support of the AgencyÂs expanding research into innovative reactors and fuel cycles, Ukraine had, since 2008, been providing cost-free expert services to INPRO. Also, it had joined the GAINS Project (International Project on Innovative Nuclear Reactors and Fuel Cycles) and had already initiated some research. 
104. Recovery efforts in the aftermath of the Chernobyl accident remained of the utmost importance for Ukraine. Ukraine had allocated a substantial portion of its State budget for that task over the years. In 2009, the Ukrainian Parliament had adopted a national programme for decommissioning the Chernobyl nuclear power plant and transforming the ÂShelterÂ into an environmentally safe system and was about to start a project on building a new and safe confinement structure over the destroyed Unit No. 4. Ukraine looked forward to continued fruitful cooperation with the Agency in that regard. It welcomed the United Nations interagency action plan on Chernobyl, in particular the planning and coordination workshop on the third decade of cooperation in Chernobyl recovery efforts. That important event had led to the adoption of the United Nations action plan on Chernobyl to 2016. 
105. Turning to technical cooperation, he expressed satisfaction with the balanced technical cooperation programme adopted by the Agency for 2009-2016. The Agency deserved high praise for elaborating the document entitled European Regional Profile for 2009-2013, which had been unanimously approved in 2008 by the Member States of the European region and served as a roadmap 
for regional cooperation. Considerable progress had been made in implementing UkraineÂs national projects on training maintenance personnel and on extending the lifetime of its nuclear power plants. Ukraine was very interested in further work on the new project on strengthening knowledge management in UkraineÂs nuclear industry, which was scheduled to be carried out in 2009-2011. 
106. Through its active cooperation with the Agency, Ukraine was able not only to benefit from best practices in the development of nuclear energy, but also to share its experience in that field with interested States. As part of the AgencyÂs activities aimed at disseminating knowledge relating to the peaceful application of nuclear technologies, Ukraine intended to continue its active collaboration on the development and implementation of regional programmes addressing non-power applications of nuclear technologies, in particular medical applications and dosimetry, as well as assistance in Chernobyl recovery efforts. 
107. Despite global economic difficulties, Ukraine supported the AgencyÂs budget for 2010, which ensured sufficient funding for all of the AgencyÂs statutory functions while not ignoring the need for its further development. 
108. Finally, speaking on behalf of the GUAM group (Azerbaijan, Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine) he noted that its members were complying fully with their obligations under their respective comprehensive safeguards agreements and additional protocols. In 2008, the GUAM countries had received assistance through the technical cooperation programme worth more than $3 million, twice the amount received in 2007. In turn, the GUAM governments regularly provided experts and cost-free services to the Secretariat and organized a wide range of activities under the AgencyÂs auspices. GUAM would work closely with the Agency in the future on high priority national and regional projects. 
109. Joint activities by the GUAM countries on cooperation and mutual support in nuclear and radiation safety were continuing and, in that connection, he emphasized the usefulness of technical and political cooperation with all interested countries. 
110. Mr MOVSISSYAN (Armenia) said that the recent resurgence of interest in nuclear power could disrupt the sensitive balance of international security. Thus, more emphasis should be placed on the NPT safeguards regime to ensure non-proliferation and the safe and peaceful use of nuclear energy. Armenia was constantly improving its national legislation and complying fully with its international commitments in that regard, including those under its additional protocol. 
111. Nuclear power was a key element of ArmeniaÂs energy policy. In October 2008, the President had presented three major strategy documents to the National Assembly, of which the most important concerned the construction of a new unit on the site of the existing nuclear power plant. With the assistance of US-AID (United States Agency for International Development), documents on the initial planning of the new unit and on its environmental impact had been drawn up and made public. The WorleyParsons company was currently preparing a feasibility study and an environmental assessment on the basis of those two documents for submission to the Government by the end of September 2009. 
112. ArmeniaÂs nuclear development programme aimed to upgrade the infrastructure and improve training of personnel, and activities were being undertaken in that regard under the AgencyÂs technical cooperation programme (project ARM/0/006). 
113. Since the recommissioning of Unit No. 2 of the Armenia nuclear power plant in 1995, his Government had spent over $90 million on improving safety levels. He thanked the many donors who had contributed to that work and commended the Agency for its valuable coordination efforts. International experts had helped to assess the seismic resistance of the plant. Modelling of various unexpected incidents and emergencies had shown that the plant was within the design limits for 
seismic resistance, and a further round of seismological, volcanological and geophysical assessments was currently under way. Also, work on expanding the existing dry storage facility for spent fuel was ongoing with construction about to enter the third phase. The planned decommissioning of the plant would be financed by a levy on electricity charges and a special government commission had been set up to manage those resources. 
114. A joint venture, the Armenian-Russian Mining Company, had been set up in July 2008 for prospecting, mining and processing of uranium in Armenia and preparations for the first prospecting activities were under way. Also, in October 2008, Armenia had joined the GNEP (Global Nuclear Energy Partnership). 
115. On the advice of an expert body set up by the Government, the State Nuclear Safety Regulatory Committee, the Armenian Nuclear Regulatory Authority (ANRA), had been accorded higher status. Much work had been done to enhance its activities at the level of upgrading both legislation and staff proficiency. The United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission was providing assistance and support for personnel training, emergency preparedness training, analysis of the second level safety report, and physical protection of nuclear materials. 
116. In closing, he expressed his appreciation for the productive collaboration between his country and the Agency. The Department of Technical Cooperation, in particular, had helped to implement a range of national and regional projects in Armenia. He likewise thanked all donors and other partners for their constant support. 
117. Mr KHELIL (Algeria) saluted outgoing Director General ElBaradei on his exceptional career, crowned by the Nobel Peace Prize in 2005. For his unflagging commitment in the service of atoms for peace he had been recognized with AlgeriaÂs highest honour, bestowed upon him by the President of the Republic, Abdelaziz Bouteflika, at the first High-Level African Regional Conference on the Contribution of Nuclear Power to Peace and Sustainable Development. A worthy representative of Africa and of the developing world, he had made the Agency a globally respected body. The title of Director General Emeritus of the IAEA, with which he had been honoured by the current General Conference, was a unanimous recognition of his inspiring human and intellectual qualities. He offered AlgeriaÂs best wishes for Mr ElBaradeiÂs future health and happiness. 
118. He also congratulated the incoming Director General, Mr Yukya Amano, wished him success, and assured him of AlgeriaÂs support and cooperation. 
119. He underscored AlgeriaÂs steadfast commitment to the peaceful and safe use of nuclear energy and the crucial importance of international cooperation in support of national development efforts, in respect of which the Agency had a unique role to play. 
120. The scientific forum on energy for development that was being held in parallel with the General Conference demonstrated the link between security and development. That was evident in the global resurgence of interest in nuclear power as a clean energy alternative, capable of meeting the growing demand for electricity in developing countries and therefore of attaining the United Nations Millennium Development Goals. 
121. The international communityÂs recent initiatives in disarmament and non-proliferation boded well for rapid growth of the peaceful applications of nuclear energy and for the success of the 2010 NPT Review Conference. Algeria welcomed recent international initiatives aimed at ridding the world of weapons of mass destruction and reinvigorating existing international commitments in that area in order to move beyond the concept of nuclear deterrence. 
122. Interest in the use of atomic energy had been confirmed by the 2nd ministerial conference held in Beijing in April 2009, and by the AgencyÂs and the OECDÂs predictions of a 66% rise in nuclear 
power generation by 2030. The Agency had a key role in ensuring that growth and needed to be given the appropriate resources to face the challenges of the nuclear renaissance. While it was difficult accurately to predict the AgencyÂs development over the next 30 years, it was a fact that 60 developing countries, Algeria among them, had requested Agency assistance in introducing nuclear power generation into their energy mix. 
123. The Agency needed to adapt to new trends, including the desire of newcomers to embark on nuclear power programmes. The significant responsibilities of the Agency in that domain would have implications for its management and its Statute. Early ratification of the amendment to Article VI would allow the Board of Governors to grow to reflect the AgencyÂs increasing membership. The Algerian delegation would do its part to ensure that the recommendations of the working group on the future of the Agency up to 2020 and beyond, established by the Chairperson of the Board of Governors, consolidated the feeling of ownership and inclusion of all Member States, and of respect for diversity without discrimination or selectivity. 
124. Algeria attached equal importance to all three of the AgencyÂs pillars. Its activities in the fields of technical cooperation, safety and security, and safeguards were necessary for a healthy and balanced Agency, and its contributions to peace and security, to development and combating poverty, and to environmental protection were of equal importance. 
125. Progress as regards nuclear safety was encouraging in view of the trepidations that continued to be aroused by nuclear power. States wishing to introduce nuclear power could benefit from the wealth of reactor operating experience worldwide, the stringent safety and efficiency standards that applied, and the advent of ever safer reactors. 
126. The increased risk of proliferation of sensitive technologies that a nuclear renaissance might bring with it had not been substantiated scientifically. Nothing could stand in the way of States deriving full benefit from the peaceful uses of nuclear energy, nor limit their rights to nuclear fuel cycle options, provided they fulfilled their international obligations. 
127. Efforts to promote multilateral nuclear fuel agreements appeared to be part of an approach aimed at bringing about a new division between those who possessed nuclear technology and those who did not. That perception could also lead to a reinterpretation of Article IV of the NPT, which would be unacceptable given the enormous concession made by the non-nuclear-weapon States in joining the NPT. 
128. Algeria attached great importance to the AgencyÂs activities aimed at preventing non-State actors from acquiring, gaining access to, or using nuclear materials or weapons. During the Âdecade of terrorismÂ, Algeria had fulfilled its nuclear security obligations by preventing nuclear materials and radioactive sources used in health care and industry from falling into the hands of terrorists. 
129. Algeria appreciated the AgencyÂs efforts in the areas of nuclear safety and security. Constant vigilance and preventive measures were required owing to the transnational nature of nuclear incidents. The AgencyÂs role in promoting a culture of safety and in helping States wishing to do so to build capacities and strengthen their infrastructure for the regulation and control of radioactive sources deserved special mention. 
130. As an institution duly mandated to verify compliance with non-proliferation commitments, the Agency had a unique role to play in maintaining peace and security. Further, the objectivity, impartiality and professionalism with which the Secretariat carried out its verification mission must be shielded from undue interference or pressure, as advocated by the AgencyÂs Statute. 
131. Algeria was encouraged that the Âno nuclear weaponsÂ campaign, which echoed its own vision of universal and complete disarmament, was prominent on the international agenda. The removal of 
impediments to the work of the Conference on Disarmament brought about during the Algerian presidency, the resumption of negotiations between the United States of America and Russia on reducing their nuclear arsenals, and the commitment of President Obama and the Chinese authorities to ratify the CTBT were positive signs. 
132. Another significant and welcome development was the entry into force in July 2009 of the Pelindaba Treaty. As the first to ratify that Treaty, Algeria saw it as a significant confidence-building measure for regional security and a concrete contribution to the efforts toward nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation of which the NPT was the cornerstone. 
133. Algeria was encouraged that many parts of the world were free of weapons of mass destruction, including nuclear weapons, as a result of the establishment of the Tlatelolco Treaty, the Rarotonga Treaty, the Bangkok Treaty, the Pelindaba Treaty, and also the Treaty of Semipalatinsk. 
134. The international community must make good its commitments to establish such a zone in the Middle East, which was desired by all of the States in the region, but which continued to come up against the steadfast refusal of Israel to join the NPT even though its leaders had publicly acknowledged its possession of nuclear weapons. Algeria urged the international community to act resolutely to irreversibly and verifiably implement the commitments made in Article VI of the NPT and the 13 steps adopted by the 2000 NPT Review Conference, over which Algeria had had the honour to preside. 
135. As regards his countryÂs cooperation activities with the Agency, he highlighted AlgeriaÂs decision to embark on nuclear power generation. Work on a suitable legal framework had begun in collaboration with the Agency and efforts were under way to elaborate a programme to enhance human resources and build capacities. 
136. Reaffirming AlgeriaÂs commitment to the AFRA programme, he said support was needed from the Agency and from African partners in order significantly to improve the ability of African countries to benefit from nuclear energy. 
137. Along with many other African countries, Algeria was interested in efforts to combat the desert locust. His delegation urged the Agency to pursue its collaboration with FAO, as the General Conference had enjoined it to do, to further develop the use of nuclear techniques for combating pests, especially the desert locust. The establishment of a locust control centre would be especially useful. 
138. Mr AHN Byong-Man (Republic of Korea) expressed his appreciation of Dr ElBaradeiÂs outstanding leadership and contribution over the previous 12 years, and congratulated the incoming Director General, Mr Amano, on his appointment. 
139. Many countries were turning to nuclear energy as the best foreseeable option to meet growing energy needs while addressing environmental concerns. Infrastructure should be developed to ensure nuclear safety, safeguards and human resources development, as well as a stable supply of nuclear fuel and improved waste management. The AgencyÂs role in that regard was becoming critically important. His Government noted with appreciation that the Agency had undertaken projects to help meet infrastructure requirements in Member States that were considering the use of nuclear power. The Republic of Korea was willing to share its 50 years of experience in the construction and management of nuclear power plants, as well as in education and training. To facilitate that sharing of experience, the Republic of Korea would be holding an international forum on nuclear safety infrastructure in 2010, and trusted that the Agency and Member States would provide support for the organization of that international event. 
140. The Agency should designate a ÂNuclear Energy DayÂ, which would provide an opportunity to promote the peaceful uses of nuclear energy and raise public confidence in a technology that was environmentally friendly and safe. 
141. International cooperation was essential if the use of nuclear energy around the world was to be expanded. The sharing of information and experience would help to reduce development cost and time, while lowering the chances of failure. One issue that had to be resolved in the Republic of Korea, for example, was the problem of spent fuel from its 20 nuclear power reactors since current capacity for temporary storage would be saturated by 2016. Various options were being considered, including research and development of advanced fuel cycle technologies. 
142. His countryÂs successful construction and operation of nuclear power plants had been made possible because of its strong emphasis on human resources, as well as technical cooperation and training programmes from the Agency and the international community. The AgencyÂs technical cooperation programme, from which his country had been benefiting since 1961, had made a vital contribution to the improvement of nuclear capabilities in Member States. From 2010, the Republic of Korea would take an active role as a technical cooperation donor country, sharing its experience and knowledge. It would also start providing extrabudgetary contributions in support of training and education efforts, particularly in those countries embarking on nuclear energy. 
143. The expanded use of nuclear energy called for an increased commitment to nuclear non-proliferation. In view of the imminent and grave challenges posed by nuclear proliferation, illicit trafficking of sensitive nuclear material, possible nuclear terrorism by non-State actors and non-compliance with safeguards obligations, it was crucial to ensure universal adherence to and compliance with the AgencyÂs comprehensive safeguards agreement and its additional protocol. The Republic of Korea called upon those States that had not signed and ratified a comprehensive safeguards agreement and additional protocol to do so without any further delay. At the same time, his country called upon the Agency to offer more incentives to States that adhered to their safeguards and non-proliferation obligations. 
144. While the Republic of Korea had expanded its use of nuclear energy, it had also consistently prioritized the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. That, however, could not be said of the DPRKÂs development of nuclear weapons, which was an unacceptable act of provocation that threatened peace and stability in north-east Asia and undermined the foundation of the international non-proliferation regime. The Republic of Korea appreciated the international communityÂs condemnation of the DPRKÂs second nuclear test through the adoption of Security Council resolution 1874 (2009) and the implementation of extensive sanctions against the DPRK. He trusted that the resolution would continue to be implemented faithfully through close international cooperation and stressed that the DPRK nuclear issue must be resolved in a peaceful manner through the six-party talks. The Agency had an important role to play in the denuclearization process, and his country hoped that the Agency would resume its monitoring and verification efforts at the earliest possible date. 
145. The Republic of Korea was committed to complying with international treaties, standards and guidelines related to nuclear safeguards, safety and security, and to strengthening cooperation with the international community. Also, it complied fully with international safety standards and requirements for nuclear power plants and had undergone an Agency OSART (Operational Safety Review Team) review. In celebration of the 30th anniversary of Kori-1, the first nuclear power plant his country, the Government had organized a special safety review team to examine, in a comprehensive manner, the safety of the 20 nuclear power plants in operation in the Republic of Korea. 
146. Ms PETERS (South Africa) said that humanity was facing a number of major challenges with regard to sustainable food production, health and security. Of critical importance was the availability 
of the energy resources required to foster sustainable development and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In that regard, the Agency was well placed to assist Member States in their efforts to meet those challenges. 
147. With regard to non-proliferation, she said that South Africa welcomed the entry into force of the Pelindaba Treaty. Those African States that had not yet acceded to the Treaty should do so as soon as possible. 
148. She recalled that, at the fifty-second session of the General Conference, South Africa had shared its concerns regarding the inability of the international community Â particularly developing countries and the African continent Â to achieve the United Nations Millennium Development Goals. It was imperative to coordinate efforts aimed at achieving those Goals across the world. A clear focus on their implementation would accelerate efforts to reinforce existing commitments in the field of development. 
149. With regard to climate change, she hoped that the UNFCCC (United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change) conference to be held in Copenhagen in December would make appropriate decisions based on the socio-economic needs of developing nations. 
150. Her country was committed to nuclear energy as part of its energy mix and intended to build industrial capacity in order to achieve that goal. To sustain nuclear generating capacity, a cabinet-level committee would be established to coordinate the implementation of South African policy in that regard, which also included a number of strategic initiatives to prepare South Africa for nuclear energy expansion. The Nuclear Energy Corporation of South Africa (NECSA) was carrying out several feasibility studies covering key aspects of the nuclear fuel cycle, with emphasis on achieving a secure fuel supply for future national energy needs while remaining economically viable and competitive in the global market. To ensure that the studies reflected fuel cycle considerations, relationships had been developed with all the main international players in fuel cycle services. Meanwhile, progress was being made in establishing laboratories and facilities to consolidate local skills and technologies, and to re-establish fuel cycle operations in South Africa. 
151. The SAFARI-I reactor core had been converted to using LEU as fuel, which was an indication of her countryÂs commitment to the responsible and sustainable use of nuclear technologies. Moreover, substantial progress had been made in developing the technology required to manufacture LEU target plates for isotope production. 
152. NECSA was helping to address the worldwide shortage of radioisotopes by increasing the production of molybdenum-99. Through NECSA, South Africa was now also represented on a special OECD committee that was considering ways of stabilizing global supplies of molybdenum-99. 
153. The resurgence in uranium mining combined with the expansion of the nuclear energy programme was expected to result in an acute shortage of skilled labour, and her country was grateful to the Agency for its continued support in providing technical training and fellowship programmes. 
154. It was important to build self-assessment capability in the African region in order to encourage greater cooperation among its regulatory bodies. In that regard, she was pleased to report that her country had been instrumental in creating a forum of nuclear regulatory bodies in Africa and had hosted its second meeting in South Africa on 26 March 2009. 
155. Noting the importance of international collaboration on matters of mutual interest with regard to nuclear safety regulation, she said that South AfricaÂs national nuclear regulator was to host the forthcoming International Conference on Effective Nuclear Regulatory Systems in Cape Town from 14 to 18 December 2009. 
156. South Africa advocated the active involvement of young people in the nuclear sector as they helped to spread the message about peaceful uses of nuclear energy. The South African Young Nuclear Professional Society, which was affiliated to the International Youth Nuclear Congress, had recently won the bid to host the International Youth in Nuclear Congress in South Africa in July 2010. 
157. The issue of gender equality had been high on South AfricaÂs agenda for many years. In 2004, the Minister of Minerals and Energy had launched a programme entitled ÂWomen in Nuclear South AfricaÂ, thus creating a forum for exchanges between women from different nuclear institutions. It aimed to promote a broader understanding of nuclear technology, safety and non-proliferation and advance the empowerment of women in the nuclear field. 
158. The President had established a Ministry of Women, Children and Persons with Disabilities. As a partner in the Southern African Development Community (SADC), South Africa had signed a binding protocol on gender and development in August 2008 in order to provide for the empowerment of women, eliminate discrimination and achieve gender equality and equity through the development and implementation of gender responsive legislation policies, programmes and projects. It included 23 targets, one of which was to ensure that women occupied 50% of decision-making posts in the public and private sectors by 2015. 
159. Turning to the safety of national nuclear facilities, she said that her country had now begun the second 10-year safety review of its Koeberg nuclear facility, which had been in operation for the past 25 years. 
160. Nuclear waste management, particularly with regard to high level radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel, was now regulated by the National Radioactive Waste Disposal Institute Act (Act No.53 of 2008). South Africa would continue to participate in international conventions, such as the Convention on Nuclear Safety and the Joint Convention. At the Third Review Meeting of the Joint Convention held in May 2009, South AfricaÂs first national report had been well received. 
161. AFRA would continue to take the lead in realizing the vision of the Pelindaba Treaty. Experts from the South African nuclear industry had continued to assist the Agency in its technical cooperation and skills transfer activities on a wide range of topics, especially as part of AFRA programmes. A total of 44 expert missions had been conducted at the AgencyÂs request, primarily to countries in Africa, the Middle East and south-east Asia. 
162. In May 2009, South Africa had hosted a nuclear security delegation from the Agency in order to determine the countryÂs nuclear security needs with regard to the 2010 football world cup tournament. South Africa was grateful to the Agency for its continued support and assistance at a time when the country was preparing to host such an important public event. 
163. South Africa considered it important to strengthen the AgencyÂs safeguards system. Verification remained an effective tool for building confidence in the safe and secure use of nuclear applications. In that regard, the additional protocol was a highly effective instrument, as it provided assurances regarding the absence of undeclared nuclear material and activities, especially in Member States with significant nuclear activities. It was incumbent upon all States with nuclear technical capabilities to build confidence and provide assurances that their nuclear capabilities were being used exclusively for peaceful purposes. 
164. With regard to the DPRK, she said her country shared the concern expressed by other Member States regarding the termination of the AgencyÂs monitoring and verification activities there. South Africa urged DPRK to allow the AgencyÂs inspectors to carry out monitoring and verification activities. South Africa has consistently called upon DPRK to terminate any nuclear weapons 
programme, return to the NPT as soon as possible, sign and ratify the CTBT, and place all its nuclear facilities and materials under comprehensive Agency safeguards. 
165. With regard to Iran, she said her country was encouraged by the increased cooperation between the Agency and that country. She urged Iran to cooperate fully with the Agency and implement the binding resolutions adopted by the Security Council. At the same time, Iran must be allowed to develop nuclear technology for peaceful applications in accordance with the letter and spirit of the NPT. She hoped that the readiness of the parties to initiate talks would lead to substantial discussions aimed at resolving the issues surrounding IranÂs nuclear programme. 
166. South Africa had the highest regard for the exemplary work and achievements of the Director General and Agency over the past 12 years, and welcomed the incoming Director General.

8. 	General debate and Annual Report for 2008 (continued) (GC(53)/7) 

1. Ms YARÂADUA (Nigeria) commended the outgoing Director General for his outstanding leadership during his twelve-year tenure and expressed deep appreciation of his support and assistance to NigeriaÂs national and regional programmes. She congratulated the Director General designate, with whom Nigeria looked forward to working, on his election, and said that Nigeria looked forward to the continued support and assistance of the Agency in its national programmes. 

2. Welcoming the new Member States, she expressed the hope that the continuous enlargement of the AgencyÂs membership would continue to strengthen international cooperation in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy, and deepen the nuclear safety culture and nuclear non-proliferation. 

3. A major fact often lost to public health policy formulators, particularly in developing countries like Nigeria, was that cancer had emerged as the primary killer. According to the available data, cancer killed more people in Nigeria than malaria and HIV/AIDS combined. Her country was therefore beginning to look towards the evolution of effective mechanisms to combat cancer, including the incorporation of nuclear medicine and radiotherapy techniques for diagnosis and management. She welcomed the assistance Nigeria had received from the Agency in establishing nuclear medicine and radiotherapy as an important component of the national strategy to control cancer, which had given impetus to intensified national efforts to develop and implement a structured nuclear medicine and radiotherapy programme for the diagnosis and management of cancer. 

4. NigeriaÂs commitment had been manifested in the approval and implementation of two major projects in the health sector in the 2009Â2011 technical cooperation cycle under which steps would be taken to develop and expand nuclear medicine facilities in ten tertiary hospitals and to strengthen existing radiotherapy facilities in six. When fully functional, the facilities were expected to provide much-needed services to alleviate the suffering of cancer patients and function as referral centres. 

5. Earlier in 2009, the foundation had been laid for an international cancer centre in Abuja. Conceived as a private-sector-driven enterprise, its primary objective was to provide a world-class facility for the diagnosis and management of cancer in Nigeria. The project was expected to benefit from the expert services and professional advice of PACT. 

6. Many developing countries, particularly in Africa, were faced with massive infrastructure challenges that had a direct impact on quality of life and threatened attainment of the MDGs by the target date of 2015. In response to NigeriaÂs huge energy deficit, her Government had made it a priority to diversify and strengthen the countryÂs energy generation base beyond current sources to include nuclear power. The initiative was being driven through the Nigeria Atomic Energy Commission with full commitment to nuclear safety, security and safeguards. Through the Nigerian Nuclear Regulatory Authority, Nigeria had developed wide-ranging regulations and guidelines to ensure nuclear safety and radiation protection, and had acceded to, and ratified, relevant treaties and conventions relating to the use of nuclear energy. The nuclear research reactor and accelerator facilities installed and commissioned with Agency assistance were being operated and utilized to promote socio-economic development. 

7. Nigeria remained committed to the basic tenets of the NPT and had placed its peaceful nuclear activities under safeguards. Her country commended the efforts of all African nations to have signed 
the Pelindaba Treaty, especially Burundi, which had become the twenty-eighth nation to deposit its instrument of ratification, leading to the TreatyÂs entry into force on 15 July 2009. Such a step demonstrated AfricaÂs commitment to the peaceful use of nuclear technology in all its forms for the continentÂs economic development and regeneration. 
8. Proliferation concerns were best addressed in a transparent, comprehensive and nonÂ­discriminatory manner, through multilateralism. The absence of a demonstrable commitment to nuclear disarmament on the part of some nuclear-weapon States could have grave consequences for the full implementation of NPT obligations by all Parties. It was also discriminatory and could erode the confidence of Member States in the AgencyÂs safeguards and verification system. 

9. Mr WIBOWO (Indonesia) congratulated the Director General designate on his appointment and expressed his countryÂs gratitude to the outgoing Director General for his outstanding contribution to the AgencyÂs work, and commended his impartial, effective and professional approach to managing the AgencyÂs affairs. 

10. Indonesia welcomed the AgencyÂs achievements in supporting progress in nuclear applications, in promoting socio-economic development and in maintaining world peace and security. Its role in promoting nuclear technology for peaceful purposes was also praiseworthy. Technical cooperation was vital to the transfer of nuclear science and technology to Member States, and served as the basic instrument for promoting peaceful uses of atomic energy for sustainable socio-economic development. As the demand for technical cooperation continued to grow, especially from developing Member States, efforts must be made to ensure that technical cooperation was funded in a sufficient, assured and predictable manner. Although Indonesia had consistently paid its share of the TCF target, it shared the concerns about the current funding system, which relied on voluntary contributions. The Agency should pursue a more balanced distribution of the budget, in order to reflect the equal importance of the three pillars of its work. The recent trend towards making the Agency primarily a tool for verification and safeguards could weaken promotional activities and was therefore a cause of concern. Moreover, the tendency to emphasize one core function over others could lead to a problematic imbalance in funding and to a loss of equilibrium. 

11. Indonesia had long advocated promoting nuclear energy for peaceful purposes and attached priority to cooperating with the Agency for the application of nuclear science and technology to improve the quality of human life, including human health. His country was particularly committed to developing an integrated and comprehensive approach to cancer, and continued to support the implementation of PACT in developing countries. Indonesia commended the AgencyÂs efforts to enhance capabilities of Member States in sustainable food security and productivity through the application of nuclear technology, and fully supported relevant technical cooperation projects. It welcomed the AgencyÂs work in radiation-induced breeding of new varieties of plants. Two highÂ­yielding, high-quality rice mutant varieties produced by irradiation techniques had been planted in an area of more than three million hectares in Indonesia. Three mutant varieties of rice produced by the Indonesian National Nuclear Energy Agency had also been introduced in early 2009. 

12. Nuclear power was emerging as one of the primary energy resources to meet a huge increase in demand for power in the medium and longer term, while mitigating the negative effect on the climate caused by the combustion of fossil fuels. The rising demand for nuclear energy and the spread of nuclear technology might bring about proliferation risks, particularly if States planned to build indigenous uranium enrichment and plutonium reprocessing capabilities. The proposals for multilateral nuclear fuel cycle mechanisms and assurances of nuclear supply sought to minimize that risk, and the creation of a multilateral fuel cycle arrangement, which would also guarantee the assurance of nuclear fuel supply, would help to strengthen the existing non-proliferation regime. Such proposals must nevertheless take account of the right of all States to develop all aspects of nuclear 
science and technology for peaceful purposes, including with regard to the nuclear fuel cycle. Indonesia appreciated the discussions on assurances of nuclear fuel supply, but agreed that all associated technical, legal, economic and political aspects should be taken into account before a final decision was taken. Moreover, any decision must be taken by consensus, taking into account the views and concerns of all Member States. 
13. The Asia-Pacific Safeguards Network established in April 2009 would enhance safeguards implementation in the Asia-Pacific region and promote regional cooperation in nuclear safeguards. The first meeting of the Network would be convened by the Nuclear Energy Regulatory Agency in Indonesia in April 2010. Membership was open to any country in the Asia-Pacific region that used nuclear materials. 

14. Indonesia was satisfied with the role of the Asian Nuclear Safety Network as the sole network promoting nuclear safety in the Asian region. At the second 2nd meeting on the nuclear safety strategy of the Asian Nuclear Safety Network held in Seoul in April 2009, it had been agreed that the Network should be a platform for regional capacity building and a centre of knowledge management for nuclear safety in Asia. 

15. Indonesia commended the AgencyÂs efforts to strengthen nuclear safety and security, and stressed that measures taken in that regard should not hamper international cooperation in the field of peaceful nuclear activities, or the utilization of nuclear technology for peaceful purposes. His country was pleased that the Agency had addressed the issues of natural events and seismic safety, and welcomed the range of extrabudgetary programmes aimed at addressing safety issues arising from tsunamis and seismic events. It also looked forward to the completion of an Agency safety report on emergency preparedness and capabilities to respond to nuclear or radiological emergencies triggered by natural disasters. 

16. The safeguards system was both a fundamental part of the global nuclear non-proliferation regime and an essential element of the pursuit of nuclear disarmament. As a party to the NPT and to the Southeast Asia Nuclear Weapon-Free-Zone, Indonesia had a comprehensive safeguards agreement and additional protocol in force, and was also implementing integrated safeguards. However, his country was concerned at the slow rate of progress being achieved in the application of safeguards agreements and additional protocols in all States, including non-nuclear and nuclear-weapon States. The failure to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East due to a single countryÂs refusal to place its nuclear installations under Agency safeguards was regrettable. That countryÂs acquisition of nuclear weapons posed a serious threat to regional security, and he called for the early implementation of Agency resolutions on the application of Agency safeguards in the Middle East. 

17. His country was also deeply disappointed with the interruption in the six-party talks. It called upon the DPRK to resume its cooperation with the Agency, return to the six-party talks and adhere to the NPT. While some of the DPRKÂs concerns needed to be addressed, it was important for the DPRK to recognize the genuine concerns of the international community and act responsibly. 

18. The Agency should continue its verification activities related to the Iranian nuclear programme and he called on all Member States to support the Director GeneralÂs efforts in that regard. The Iranian nuclear issue must be resolved through dialogue, cooperation, diplomacy and other peaceful means. He therefore urged Iran to provide the Agency with all the support and cooperation it needed in order to perform its tasks. 

19. Mr BIGOT (France) said that the Agency had a key role to play, not only in ensuring the nonÂ­diversion of nuclear technologies and materials, but also as a driving force in the responsible development of civil nuclear power, in particular by promoting a safety culture and strict safety standards in Member States and by disseminating information related to the application of nuclear 
technologies in areas including health, nutrition, agriculture and water resources. The Agency also contributed to nuclear security, including the fight against nuclear terrorism. He assured the Director General designate of his delegationÂs full support and thanked the outgoing Director General for his outstanding work. 
20. With a growing number of countries looking to nuclear energy to meet their rising energy demands, the international community must sustain its efforts to address non-proliferation challenges, including the Iranian and DPRK nuclear issues. Iran continued to accumulate low-enriched uranium, in violation of United Nations Security Council resolutions. It had still not provided a satisfactory response to the AgencyÂs questions about possible activities linked to the design and manufacture of nuclear weapons. The Agency had an essential role to play in informing the international community of developments concerning the Iranian nuclear issue, and the French President had recently suggested that the Agency should be given strengthened powers of inspection in such situations. 

21. The actions of the DPRK in conducting a second nuclear test and firing several missiles were unacceptable. He called for the return of Agency inspectors to the DPRK and for the full, verifiable and irreversible dismantlement of that countryÂs nuclear weapons programme, in conformity with United Nations Security Council resolutions. The DPRK must meet its obligations under the NPT and its safeguards agreement, and France supported the AgencyÂs efforts to that end. The DPRK must halt all proliferation activities and refrain from the export of certain items, as prohibited by United Nations Security Council resolutions 1718 (2006) and 1874 (2009). The six-party talks provided the framework for a resumption of dialogue on denuclearization, and the DPRK should return promptly and without precondition to the negotiating table. 

22. France, which would continue to support the AgencyÂs investigations into the issue, called on the Syrian Arab Republic to demonstrate transparency and to cooperate fully in the implementation of its safeguards agreement. 

23. The NPT remained the cornerstone of the non-proliferation regime, and France looked forward to a successful outcome of the 2010 NPT Review Conference. 

24. The right to use nuclear energy brought with it the duty for States to honour their nonÂ­proliferation commitments and pursue peaceful nuclear activities. Grave violation of those obligations by any State undermined mutual trust and hampered the development of international cooperation on the peaceful uses of nuclear energy, to the detriment of the vast majority of States that fulfilled their obligations in good faith. A strengthened and universal safeguards system would be of benefit to all, and would facilitate the expansion of nuclear energy in the world while enhancing nuclear security and protection against nuclear terrorism. However, the AgencyÂs capacity for detecting undeclared nuclear activities would remain limited unless States implemented an additional protocol. France therefore called upon all States that had not yet done so to conclude safeguards agreements and additional protocols without delay. 

25. Through its safeguards support programme, France would continue supporting the Agency by providing expertise and by promoting the development of technologies to detect clandestine nuclear activities. 

26. The identification of an international network for the trafficking of sensitive technologies had highlighted the need for strict and universally applicable export controls for the most sensitive nuclear technologies, equipment and materials, particularly as more States developed their nuclear capacity. 

27. The transfer of such technologies, particularly those linked to enrichment and reprocessing, should benefit those countries that complied fully with their non-proliferation obligations and that required the technologies to develop a credible nuclear power programme. Recipient and exporting 
countries must engage in long-term partnerships to ensure the safe, secure, proliferation-resistant and environmentally sound transfer and use of those technologies. 
28. Nuclear terrorism remained a threat and States must take all necessary measures to continue to improve the levels of physical protection for nuclear installations and materials to ensure compliance with the most stringent security requirements. Firm action was required to prevent the acquisition and use of nuclear or radioactive materials by terrorists. To that end, States should accede to relevant international legal instruments, including the CPPNM and the amendment thereto, and the International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism. France welcomed the AgencyÂs activities in promoting the security of nuclear materials and installations, and supported the Nuclear Security Plan for 2010Â2013. 
29. The International Ministerial Conference on Nuclear Energy in the 21st Century held in April had affirmed that nuclear energy, as a proven, clean, safe, competitive technology, would make an increasing contribution to the sustainable development of humankind throughout the 21st century and beyond. Nuclear energy, along with other non-greenhouse gas-emitting energy sources, was an integral part of the energy mix that could help to reduce the risks of climate change. That topic would be addressed by all stakeholders at a forthcoming international conference to be organized by France in close cooperation with the Agency. 
30. France had more than thirty yearsÂ experience in using nuclear energy for power generation. It was ready to assist the increasing number of States expressing an interest in developing civilian nuclear programmes, provided that they respected their non-proliferation commitments and were committed to using nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. Such cooperation would be based on full respect for the most stringent safety, security and non-proliferation requirements as an essential precondition for the responsible development of nuclear energy, and would focus on the establishment of the necessary framework and infrastructure for the safe and efficient use of nuclear energy. FranceÂs International Nuclear Agency would provide assistance to States, notably in the area of staff training and development. A Masters programme in nuclear engineering had been launched in 2009; it was run by a consortium of leading academic institutions in cooperation with the National Institute of Nuclear Science and Technology under the auspices of the Atomic Energy Commission. The course was taught entirely in English and open to foreign students. In addition, since the beginning of 2008, France had signed seven bilateral intergovernmental cooperation agreements in the field of nuclear energy. 
31. The global expansion of nuclear power should be accompanied by international debate on multilateral approaches to the fuel cycle. France welcomed the decision taken by the Council of the European Union to contribute to the establishment of a fuel bank under Agency control, which was one of the initiatives aimed at further strengthening the already high level of security in the nuclear fuel market. 
32. France actively supported the technical cooperation programme, the benefits of which should be distributed equally among the least developed countries. Noting that the financing and strengthening of technical cooperation activities were the responsibility of all Member States, he said that in addition to supporting projects concerning the development of nuclear power, France would also be supporting projects in the area of human health, notably within the framework of AFRA and ARCAL. 
33. The establishment of national regulatory infrastructures for nuclear safety and radiation protection was a prerequisite for the development of nuclear technology. All States, particularly those looking to develop nuclear programmes, should accede to the relevant international legal instruments, including the Nuclear Safety Convention and the Joint Convention. Those States that had not already done so should also take the necessary steps to ratify those instruments. 
34. As nuclear programmes expanded and more states joined the global nuclear community, France would continue to support the AgencyÂs efforts to enhance safety through international cooperation. It had increased its voluntary contribution to the extrabudgetary programme on the seismic safety of existing nuclear power plants and would provide several cost-free experts to the Department of Nuclear Safety and Security. 
35. France welcomed the AgencyÂs efforts to organize IRRS missions, and urged Member States to avail themselves of that service with a view to the continued improvement of national safety authorities. 
36. With regard to transport safety, he said that France was continuing to engage in dialogue and consultations with its partners and concerned costal States in order to promote mutual understanding and confidence regarding the safe maritime transport of radioactive materials. He drew attention to the importance of the universal application of a civil liability regime in the nuclear field, and called on all States to accede to either the Paris Convention or the Vienna Convention, and adapt their domestic legislation where necessary. 
37. Approximately 80% of electricity in France came from nuclear power plants. The 58 reactors currently in operation strengthened his countryÂs energy independence and security, while reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Noting that, for more than 30 years, France had pursued the same responsible energy policy and had equipped itself with the tools required to deal with radioactive waste, opting for closed cycle reprocessing, he said that plans were being made for the construction of a second European Pressurized Reactor at Penly. Research activities were continuing and a prototype fast neutron reactor was expected to be developed by 2020, which would further enhance the energy potential of nuclear materials and could provide an innovative solution for the efficient reprocessing of minor actinides. A new research reactor was to be built at Cadarache, which would begin producing radioisotopes in 2015 and was expected to meet 25% of European requirements. 
38. Turning to the supply of medical radioisotopes, he said that the repeated shortages of Molybdenum-99 in recent years had highlighted weaknesses in the radioisotope production chain. The shutdown of the Canadian Chalk River reactor in May 2009 had exacerbated the situation and had implications for patientsÂ access to nuclear medicine diagnostic tests. France was participating actively in the international debate on how to resolve the problems associated with ensuring the supply or radioisotopes for medical use. The high-level group on the security of supply of medical radioisotopes set up by the OECD/NEA should cooperate closely with the Agency, especially in regard to the economic model to be used to meet demand. 
39. International cooperation was essential for the development of a new generation of reactors that were more competitive, safer, more proliferation resistant and generated less long-lived radioactive waste. France participated actively in the AgencyÂs INPRO project and had made an extrabudgetary contribution in 2009 to promote the participation of emerging nuclear States. France also participated in the GIF and had hosted a symposium marking the tenth anniversary of the Forum at the beginning of September. 
40. Preparations of the ITER site at Cadarache would be completed by February 2010, and it was to be hoped that the fifth ITER Council meeting to be held on 18 and 19 November 2009 in Cadarache would give the go-ahead for the construction of the reactor. France was pleased to note that the Agency and the ITER Organization had signed a cooperation agreement facilitating an exchange of information and training. 
41. France was actively involved in informal consultations among Member States on the future of the Agency, and would welcome the development of a long-term strategy on issues such as the AgencyÂs key objectives, methods of financing and management. It was essential that the Agency had 
the resources it required to undertake its statutory duties, and France welcomed the establishment of a working group to consider the priorities of the Agency and their budgetary implications. 
42. Mr NICOLAS (Haiti) paid tribute to the efforts of the outgoing Director General, which had won acclaim for the Agency in the fields of non-proliferation and nuclear security, and trusted that the incoming Director General would maintain the current momentum in the Agency's work. 
43. Having welcomed the new members of the Agency, he said that Haiti hoped that other States would join the Agency so that their populations could also enjoy the advantages offered by the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. His Government recommended that the Secretariat send missions to countries that were not yet members to raise awareness. In January 2009, an Agency official had participated in the 14th Ordinary Meeting of the Ministerial Council of the Association of Caribbean States, during which options for cooperation with the Caribbean countries had been discussed, and a framework agreement was now under preparation. Haiti also urged the Agency to contact, for example, the Organization of American States about the possibility of establishing partnerships with countries in the Americas. 
44. The Government of Haiti attached great importance to the AgencyÂs technical cooperation programme. The AgencyÂs work in fields such as water, energy, agriculture, health and the environment might be integrated with that of other United Nations bodies in Haiti, for example through UNDAF. He hoped that a technical mission could shortly be sent to Haiti to discuss with UNDP the feasibility of such a project. The AgencyÂs technical cooperation activities in Haiti had increased in recent years, and projects were being implemented in areas including energy planning, water resources management and increasing agricultural productivity. Haiti could find solutions to many of its development problems through ever more effective cooperation with the Agency. It was currently experiencing difficulties in setting up its radiotherapy centre but was confident that the problems would be solved soon. His Government requested once again that an imPACT mission be sent to Haiti to perform a systematic evaluation of HaitiÂs needs in terms of cancer treatment. 
45. For almost six years, Haiti had actively participated in ARCAL and had received vital assistance in diverse and strategic areas. ARCAL was at a turning point and its institutional strengthening was increasingly under discussion. His country invited other regional bodies such as AFRA, ARASIA and the RCA to strengthen their cooperation with ARCAL. Haiti welcomed the efforts of the Board of ARCAL Representatives and looked forward to working with the new ARCAL executive board. 
46. The Agency needed to provide for technical assistance with regard to bi-national projects between Haiti and the Dominican Republic, in particular concerning the management of shared aquifers and environmental management using isotopic and nuclear techniques. 
47. Since 2007, Haiti had repeatedly stressed the need for the Agency to pay particular attention to LDCs, a group that included Haiti. In the context of efforts to ensure that international organizations included the specific problems of LDCs in their programmes, Haiti had submitted a draft resolution to the General Conference in 2008 on making the LDC issue a permanent agenda item. The intention was not to disadvantage any group or to demand additional funding, but to ensure that Agency technical assistance was tailored to the needs of LDCs in order to help them meet the objectives of the Rio and Brussels Declarations and the MDGs. 
48. The Board of Governors must consider the increasing budgetary and financial problems facing the Agency which could affect its future and that of the stronger global nuclear order outlined in the report of the Commission of Eminent Persons in 2008. Haiti would, despite the many difficulties it faced, do all it could to make its modest contribution to the AgencyÂs financial and budgetary efforts. 
49. Haiti was fully committed to the efforts to combat all forms of terrorism, including nuclear and radiological terrorism, and his Government supported the efforts of the international community to prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Lastly, Haiti encouraged all States party to the NPT to comply with the Treaty, since that was the only way to achieve a reinforced global nuclear order. 
Mr Tan (Singapore), Vice-President, took the Chair. 

50. Bishop SÂNCHEZ SORONDO (Holy See) said that, in his recent Encyclical Letter entitled ÂCaritas in veritateÂ , Pope Benedict XVI had sought to highlight the goals and values to be tirelessly pursued, promoted and defended in order to build a human family that was free and united, and in a position to promote effectively a truly integral human development. He had stated that the risk for our time was that the de facto interdependence of people and nations was not matched by ethical interaction of consciences and minds that would give rise to truly human development. That risk appeared to be even more pronounced when set against the backdrop of the challenges posed by the global Ânuclear renaissanceÂ, such as disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation, increased demand for energy, terrorism, and the black market for nuclear material. Those challenges could only be addressed seriously by cultivating a culture of peace founded upon the primacy of law and respect for human life. In order to respond to those challenges and fulfil its mandate, the Agency could and must contribute to favouring the "ethical interaction of consciences and minds". 

51. There was an urgent need for the ethically responsible use of scientific and technical knowledge that, especially in the nuclear field, must always be applied for the common good, with full respect for international law and for the purposes of genuine development, in an environmentally friendly manner sensitive to the most disadvantaged populations. Through the technical cooperation programme, the Agency could and should play an important role in promoting a more responsible and appropriate application of nuclear technology not only in the energy field, but also in medicine, agriculture, hydrology, food security and access to drinking water. Such activities must form part of a broader ethical framework for development, since they had important implications for current as well as future generations. Funding for such activities must be seen as an investment for the future of humanity. 

52. The development of peoples depended, above all, on a recognition that the human race was a single family working together in true communion, not simply a group of subjects who happened to live side by side. The approach to multilateralism should therefore be permeated by dialogue and honesty, as well as by responsible cooperation among all parties within the international community. States should pursue the development and wellbeing of all nations and peoples rather than economic or military national power, with the human being as the essential point of reference. Such a multilateral approach must be marked by the development of a new paradigm of collective security, in which each country recognized the clear limits of recourse to nuclear weapons for its own security. Humanity was at a difficult crossroads, characterized by ever-increasing interdependence involving economic, political, social and other factors. The use of force would serve only to increase mutual distrust, and used enormous resources in a near-sighted way. The temptation to confront new situations with old systems must be avoided. Priorities and hierarchies of values should be redefined with a view to achieving moral, cultural and economic development, since development, solidarity and justice were none other than the true name for a lasting peace. 

53. The surveillance and monitoring activities of the Agency should be understood not as a means of limiting the legitimate interests of States, but as a guarantee for the security and the common good of all peoples. Even civilian programmes involving dual-use technology required effective international monitoring, while respecting the freedom of States. However, threats to security arose ultimately from attitudes and actions hostile to human nature, so it was important to act on the human level of cultural values and ethics. If, in the short term, technical and legal measures were needed to 
protect nuclear sites and materials and prevent acts of nuclear terrorism, then there was also a need in the long term for preventive measures that might affect the deeper cultural and social roots of crime and terrorism. Particular emphasis must be placed on codes of conduct for staff working in the nuclear field who should always take account of the possible consequences of their activities; the AgencyÂs initiatives in that field were invaluable and should be strengthened. In its work, the Agency must always aim to unite and associate, not to divide and oppose. 
54. The development of nuclear energy programmes for civil use posed potential new challenges to the non-proliferation regime, which would be weakened unless specific steps were taken towards disarmament. The Holy See remained convinced that non-proliferation and disarmament were interdependent and a major tool for combating nuclear terrorism and creating a culture of peace. The Holy See welcomed the steps being taken to put disarmament at the heart of the international debate on peace and security. Recent initiatives meant there was still hope of achieving a world free of nuclear weapons. That augured well for the outcome of the next NPT Review Conference, where the international community would need to put in place specific measures. Negotiations on the FMCT were due to begin shortly, and every effort should be made to facilitate the entry into force of the CTBT. 

55. The nuclear renaissance appeared to offer opportunities for prosperity, but might be nothing more than an illusion if it was not accompanied by a cultural and moral renaissance. Mere material wealth did not eliminate the risks and conflicts related to poverty and cultural and moral misery. For that reason, nuclear policies must be considered from the perspective of the integral development of the human person. A common commitment to peace and security could lead not only to an equitable distribution of resources, but above all to the establishment of a social and international order in which the rights and freedoms of all human persons could be fully realized. 

56. Mr HOMANN (Germany) congratulated the incoming Director General on his appointment, and thanked the outgoing Director General for the professionalism with which he had handled the most difficult and delicate subjects in the fields of nuclear non-proliferation and verification over the previous twelve years. 

57. In July 2009, the Board of Governors had decided to increase the regular budget of the Agency by 5.4 % for 2010. Although that decision did not reflect GermanyÂs position, his delegation had not wished to block consensus. However, the additional burden on the national budget as a result of the global financial crisis required Germany to pursue a consistent policy of zero growth with respect to the budget of international organizations, including the Agency. The Secretariat and Member States should find additional mechanisms to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of the Agency, and he drew attention in that regard to the implementation of integrated safeguards within the framework of the additional protocol. The working group recently established by the Board would provide a useful opportunity to discuss the AgencyÂs requirements in detail. That being said, GermanyÂs general intention was to support the Agency where specific needs arose. It had pledged an amount of up to ?10 million until 2012 for activities in the field of nuclear security aimed at securing vulnerable radiological sources and at securing and modernizing the Seibersdorf laboratories. 

58. Germany was gravely concerned about the nature of the Iranian nuclear programme. The most recent Agency report clearly showed that Iran was continuing to develop its uranium enrichment activities and to withhold cooperation concerning the alleged military dimension of its nuclear programme, in violation of binding United Nations Security Council resolutions and relevant calls from the Board. In so doing, Iran was further reinforcing doubts about the nature of its nuclear programme, instead of building trust. A comprehensive offer of cooperation had been put forward, and the EU3+3 remained willing to engage in immediate talks with Iran. The only way for Iran to restore confidence was by cooperating fully with the international community in order to resolve the 
outstanding issues. Germany and its other EU3+3 partners had carefully studied IranÂs proposal package, and remained committed to meaningful negotiations with Iran to resolve international concerns about the Iranian nuclear programme. 
59. Germany was also gravely concerned about the nuclear weapons programme pursued by the DPRK. The recent nuclear and missile tests had been unequivocally condemned by the international community and had highlighted the undiminished importance of the AgencyÂs monitoring activities. The DPRK should allow the Agency to resume its work. He drew attention to the importance of preventing the proliferation for material to and from the DPRK, and called upon all States to comply with their obligations under United Nations Security Council resolution 1874 (2009). The complete and verifiable denuclearization of the Korean peninsula remained the ultimate goal, and he called on the DPRK to return to the six-party talks without delay. 

60. His country shared the AgencyÂs concern about possible undeclared nuclear activities in the Syrian Arab Republic, which would run counter to that countryÂs commitments under its safeguards agreement. He called on Syria to improve cooperation with the Agency, notably by responding to outstanding questions and providing access to related sites. All parties concerned should cooperated fully with the Agency with a view to facilitating further clarification. 

61. Those developments had again highlighted the need for an effective and efficient safeguards regime. Comprehensive safeguards agreements together with the additional protocol should therefore be considered the verification standard. 

62. The Board of Governors had recently started its discussion of assurances of supply and of the three proposals submitted in connection with multilateral nuclear approaches. Germany welcomed the proposal of the United Kingdom on nuclear fuel assurances and noted that multilateral approaches offered a promising way to provide for reliable access to nuclear fuel. Germany had developed the Multilateral Enrichment Sanctuary Project, which offered a market compatible option for independent access to nuclear fuel cycle services. Germany would respond to the questions raised in due course. 

63. The self-assessment conducted in the run-up to the recent IRRS mission to Germany and the subsequent visit of the reviewers had set in motion a complex and important process for improving GermanyÂs regulatory body. His delegation hoped that other Member States operating nuclear power plants would avail themselves of such missions. Over recent years, Germany had sent experts to act as reviewers in other IRRS missions and would continue to support the service actively in that way. 

64. Germany welcomed the announcement by President of the United States at the 2009 G8 Summit that his country would host a high-level summit on global nuclear security in March 2010. That event would provide an opportunity to consider the different initiatives and programmes already being implemented with a view to promoting coordination in order to achieve synergies and increased ÂGlobal ZeroÂ initiative. 

65. Germany greatly appreciated the assistance provided through the AgencyÂs technical cooperation programme, which led to noticeable improvements in essential areas such as health, water management, agriculture and environmental protection. His country would continue to support the AgencyÂs valuable efforts in that regard. 

66. Mr MSOLLA (United Republic of Tanzania) commended the outgoing Director General for his leadership of the Agency over the previous 12 years and congratulated the incoming Director General on his election. 

67. He expressed appreciation for the message delivered to the General Conference on behalf of the United Nations Secretary-General, which provided valuable guidance and would contribute to the further strengthening of the AgencyÂs activities, particularly in the formulation of appropriate 
strategies and programmes for the advancement of peaceful applications of nuclear technology and the non-proliferation regime. 
68. He hoped that the AgencyÂs technical cooperation activities would be continued and strengthened, and noted that Tanzania, like other LDCs, urgently required technical assistance for the acquisition, adoption, adaptation and use of appropriate nuclear technologies for economic development and poverty alleviation. Peace and development could not coexist in the long term with abject poverty; democracy and good governance could not grow amidst poverty, disease and deprivation. Prosperity therefore very much depended on alleviating poverty, and his country called on the Agency and the international community to intensify technical cooperation activities. The strategic applications of nuclear technology in targeted areas such as sustainable energy development, health, food crop and livestock improvement, water resources management and sanitation could contribute immensely to poverty alleviation, particularly in LDCs like Tanzania, which was following with keen interest the use of nuclear technology for electricity production and other beneficial purposes. 
69. The increasing attention being given to cancer therapy in developing countries was welcome, as was the support provided through PACT. Under that Programme, Tanzania was receiving assistance in establishing a centre of excellence at the Ocean Road Cancer Institute in Dar es Salaam, where the majority of cancer patients in Tanzania received radiotherapy treatment. However, more centres, more machines and a corresponding number of qualified staff would be required to meet future demand. Tanzania was pleased that its call for expanded services for cancer treatment had been heard, and would work to ensure that PACT activities contributed significantly to helping save lives. 
70. In terms of regional initiatives to promote prosperity, he highlighted AFRA, which Tanzania had chaired during the transition period following the decision made by the High Level Policy Review Seminar held in Aswan, Egypt in November 2007. The Aswan Declaration sought to support the improvement of AFRAÂs managerial procedures, increase effectiveness and efficiency and promote full ownership of AFRA programmes by Member States. The decision made at that Seminar to increase the number of AFRA management committees from one to three would become effective following endorsement at a meeting of representatives due to be held during the present session of the General Conference. In addition, the 19th Meeting of AFRA Representatives, held in October 2008, had endorsed the decision to establish the AFRA Fund as a vehicle for collecting voluntary contributions from donors and AFRA Member States to support the implementation of AFRA projects, all of which would require the support of the Agency and the international community. 
71. Tanzania met its obligations to the Agency through the timely payment of its share of the regular budget. It had established an adequate legal framework governing the safe and peaceful uses of nuclear energy, and had already ratified a number of treaties, conventions and agreements in accordance with Agency guidelines. Lastly, he pledged TanzaniaÂs full share of the TCF target. 
72. Mr CHOREV (Israel) said that his country looked forward to working with the incoming Director General. 
73. In the context of the worldwide nuclear renaissance, the intensive development of nuclear energy was highly desirable; however, proliferation risks associated with inherently dual-use nuclear fuel cycle technologies must be minimized. Each State had an absolute duty to honour its international non-proliferation obligations and commitments and not to abuse its right to use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. 
74. Israel attached great importance to the nuclear non-proliferation regime, and despite the geopolitical realities in the Middle East, its long-standing policy was to support and wherever possible join arms control and other international treaties. His Government appreciated acknowledgement of IsraelÂs narrow security margins. 
75. One recent development in non-proliferation was the renewed interest in multilateral nuclear arms control and disarmament led by the President of the United States of America. Israel had continued to contribute to the global non-proliferation regime through its policy of responsible behaviour and restraint in the nuclear domain, repeatedly stating that it would not be the first to introduce nuclear weapons to the Middle East. Therefore it was regrettable that the outgoing Director General had repeatedly misrepresented his countryÂs policy in that regard. 
76. The continuous growth of IsraelÂs energy needs coupled with its total dependence on foreign energy sources posed a complex national challenge, which could be addressed through its advanced nuclear expertise. 
77. Turning to IsraelÂs vision and policy regarding the transformation of the Middle East to a zone free of weapons of mass destruction, he said that Israel had always believed that the nuclear issue and other security issues could only be realistically addressed in a regional context. The recent entry into force of the Pelindaba Treaty provided an excellent example of such an approach. The process of establishing the Middle East as a zone free of WMDs should begin with confidence-building measures, followed by mutual recognition, reconciliation and peaceful relations, culminating in conventional and non-conventional arms control measures. That vision could not be realized without a fundamental change in regional circumstances, including a transformation in the attitudes of States towards Israel. 
78. Nuclear proliferation developments of grave concern had taken place in recent years, with the most widely recognized cases of non-compliance with non-proliferation obligations occurring in the Middle East by States party to the NPT. The AgencyÂs investigations in Iran and Syria had been hampered by a lack of cooperation and denial of access. He hoped that the activities in those countries would soon be clarified. It was crucial to enhance the AgencyÂs inspection and verification activities. Agency investigations needed to be conducted free of extraneous influences, and countries that failed to meet their obligations must be subject to immediate, international measures. 
79. Adequate measures to ensure nuclear safety and security were vital to ensuring international acceptance of the civil nuclear industry. The Israel Atomic Energy Commission pursued uncompromising standards of safety in its two nuclear research centres. 
80. In view of the threat of nuclear terrorism, cooperation was needed to ensure that the materials terrorists would need to build a radiological or improvised nuclear device were secure. Israel commended the Agency for addressing the prevention of illicit trafficking in nuclear and radioactive materials. It had also joined the Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism and the Megaports Initiative led by the United States, and welcomed the decision of the President of the United States to host a global nuclear security summit in 2010. 
81. It was regrettable that some countries were imposing politically motivated agenda items on the General Conference in an apparent effort either to single out Israel or to divert attention from the issues of non-compliance by certain Middle East States. The item on Israeli nuclear capabilities had been removed by agreement from the agenda in 1993 and never acted upon since. Among the sponsors of that draft resolution were countries that did not recognize the State of Israel and even called for its annihilation. He would question the moral standing of those sponsors that did not recognize IsraelÂs right to exist while criticizing Israeli policies aimed at securing that very existence. 
82. Israel had joined the consensus on the agenda item concerning the application of safeguards in the Middle East for 14 consecutive years, despite its grave reservations about the modalities and about the relevance of the General Conference as a forum to address the issue. Consensus had been lost on the resolution in 2006, because of the uncompromising attitude of the sponsors of the resolution who were aiming at extraneous political goals, which also raised doubts as to whether it was their genuine 
aim to establish the Middle East as a NWFZ. During recent months Israel had approached Egypt directly and through other governments, hoping to reach an agreed language on Middle East issues at the General Conference. Israel had also responded positively to the efforts by several delegations and the President of the Conference to work together towards a positive outcome. It was not too late to reach a consensus on the item and Israel would cooperate fully. 
83. IranÂs initiative to promote agenda item 24 on the prohibition of armed attack or threat of attack against nuclear installations was a clear case of hypocrisy. Iran hoped that the international community would condone its violations of its obligations and long-standing deception campaign. No diplomatic smoke screen and manoeuvring at the Agency General Conference could obscure the real facts and findings, which were that Iran had not cooperated with the Agency and that, should the information obtained be real, there was a high probability that nuclear weaponization activities had taken place. The Government of Israel and many others believed that the information the Agency had was accurate and real, and he called on all delegations to reject the transparent and cynical move of Iran. 
84. Mr AL SAUD (Saudi Arabia) expressed his countryÂs appreciation of the tireless efforts of the outgoing Director General to promote the interests of the Agency since his appointment in 1997. He was confident that the incoming Director General would pursue the same successful course. 
85. Nuclear energy now played a vital role in electricity generation and industrial infrastructure for almost half of the population of the planet, even though 2008 had been the first year for five decades in which there had been no start-up of a nuclear reactor. However, there had been many positive developments, such as the building of a number of nuclear power plants, mostly in Asia, requests for licences to build new nuclear power plants, and an increasing number of technical cooperation projects involving analysis of energy options and preparations for the use of nuclear energy. In that context, he commended the Agency on its convening of the International Ministerial Conference on Nuclear Energy in the 21st Century in China in April 2009. 
86. Saudi Arabia supported efforts to prevent the current economic and financial crisis from having an adverse impact on the expansion of applications of nuclear technology and welcomed the continued cooperation to that end between the Agency and the FAO. 
87. The Agency had successfully laid the basis for a global nuclear safety regime aimed at ensuring optimum nuclear safety and security in Member States through extensive sharing of knowledge, expertise and lessons learned, strengthening of infrastructure, training of human resources, early warning of accidents and emergencies, waste safety, safe decommissioning of nuclear facilities, rehabilitation of contaminated sites, wide application of nuclear safety standards, use of review and guidance services, implementation of relevant international instruments, and establishment of a civil liability regime for nuclear damage. In spite of the progress achieved in recent decades, the Agency must continue to improve and promote nuclear safety standards and to assist States in complying with them. However, the promotion of safety and security, responsibility for which lay with the countries concerned, should not be undertaken at the expense of the development of peaceful applications of nuclear energy. His country supported action to develop international mechanisms enabling the Agency to verify the safety of nuclear power plants alongside its existing verification activities. Saudi Arabia commended the Agency's technical cooperation activities and its bilateral and multilateral partnerships in that context. It encouraged the Agency to continue studying issues that had a bearing on the effectiveness of such activities, particularly the availability of predictable and assured resources under the TCF. In fact, Saudi Arabia believed that it would be preferable to finance the technical cooperation programme under the Agency's regular budget. 
88. The Agency played a key role in ensuring non-proliferation through its verification of StatesÂ compliance with their safeguards obligations. However, other components of the NPT were equally 
important, such as nuclear disarmament and the transfer of nuclear technology for peaceful purposes. Impartial mechanisms similar to those concerning verification and safeguards should be developed for that purpose. The AgencyÂs credibility in applying the safeguards regime under the NPT depended to a large extent on its success in meeting current challenges, particularly the development of Agency safeguards and verification laboratories that guaranteed full neutrality. 
89. Saudi Arabia noted that despite efforts to promote the universality of the NPT, sensitive regions, including the Middle East, were still not fully covered. Israel remained outside the NPT and the verification regime, and Agency documents failed to mention IsraelÂs refusal to accede to the Treaty or to apply comprehensive safeguards to its nuclear installations. The persistence of that anomaly was likely to encourage other States to breach their obligations. It opened the door to all kinds of transgressions and delaying tactics that undermined the AgencyÂs credibility and neutrality. The Director General should take a strong stand against IsraelÂs intransigence. Saudi Arabia therefore welcomed the incoming Director General's statement that he was committed to adopting a balanced approach to the application of the non-proliferation regime. The Member States of the Agency should also take more determined action on the issue, avoiding the disputes and delaying tactics that had been a feature of previous General Conferences. 
90. It was essential to provide the Agency with sufficient funds to maintain its capacity to fulfil its mandate effectively. However, the AgencyÂs budgets should be restructured. It was inappropriate to continue placing heavy financial burdens on Member States through increases in the regular budget. Moreover, the shielding system might be reintroduced to cushion the impact of increases in the safeguards budget on developing Member States at a time of global financial crisis. Other possibilities included the reappraisal of financial priorities and measures to achieve greater efficiency and cost savings in basic programmes. Nuclear security activities should be financed from voluntary contributions and extrabudgetary sources since they did not form part of the AgencyÂs basic mandate. It would therefore be inappropriate to incorporate part of the nuclear security programme in the regular budget without considering at the same time a proposal to address the long-term funding of the technical cooperation programme. The basic aim should be to achieve balance in the allocation of the AgencyÂs resources to development and verification activities. 
91. Mr SADDO (Ethiopia) congratulated the outgoing Director General for having successfully led the Agency during his three terms of office and warmly welcomed the Director General designate. 
92. His Government was implementing far-reaching reforms in its public organizations with a view to creating effective and transparent institutions better able to implement the policies, strategies and action plans of a developing State. Critical areas to be addressed included gaps in infrastructure, political and economic transformation, and science and technology capacity building. A Ministry of Science and Technology had also been established. 
93. Ethiopia was involved in an increasing number of national and regional technical cooperation projects in the areas of agriculture, human health, water resources development, non-destructive testing, energy planning, nuclear instrumentation and radiation protection. The project with the highest priority was the project on creating a tsetse-free zone in the Southern Rift Valley, which aimed to eradicate tsetse flies from 25 000 km2 of land using the SIT. The project was gradually moving closer to achieving its objectives, and a decisive stage had been reached where the cooperation and assistance of all partners was more crucial than ever. Regrettably, the project had been delayed as a result of poor organization; strong measures would be taken in order to rectify the situation, including the restructuring of the project, and the development of a new national organizational arrangement. His Government was grateful to the Agency and all those that were supporting EthiopiaÂs efforts to make the project a success. 
94. As a result of its technical cooperation activities with the Agency, Ethiopia had built up a modest national infrastructure for the application of nuclear medicine, radiotherapy and isotope hydrology. However, it still had only one radiotherapy centre with a single cobalt machine to serve more than 75 million people. Preliminary data indicated that only around 400 cancer patients received radiotherapy treatment per year, despite an estimated 115 000 new cancer cases annually. To narrow the gap between the increasing demand for radiotherapy services, and their limited supply, an action plan had been developed with the assistance of the Agency to expand radiotherapy and nuclear medicine services to five university hospitals around the country. His Government was mobilizing resources from local, bilateral and multilateral sources, and he urged the Agency and Member States to increase their technical and financial support for his countryÂs endeavours to save thousands of lives each year by strengthening and expanding radiotherapy services. 
95. Ethiopia had also developed a basic capacity to generate useful isotopic data. Steps taken included the establishment of an isotope hydrology laboratory at the Addis Ababa University, the development of a national groundwater database, and the training of personnel. A memorandum of understanding between four counterpart institutions had been signed, and high-level steering and technical committees established to monitor its proper implementation. 
96. Ethiopia remained committed to the peaceful application of nuclear technologies, and respect of global, regional and national peace, safety and security. He called for Member States to work towards a world free from nuclear weapons, through the implementation of all relevant international guiding principles and treaties, including the CTBT. The recent entry into force of the Pelindaba Treaty was a clear reflection of the commitment of the African States towards more transparency and cooperation, and Ethiopia called upon all African Member States to ratify that instrument. 
97. He was proud that the Prime Minister of Ethiopia would be leading the African Group to the forthcoming United Nations Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen. Nuclear power, which was a reliable and clean source of energy, might go some way to providing solution to the problem of global warming. 
98. In conclusion, he thanked the Secretariat for its dedication and hard work to make cooperation with his country more relevant. 
99. Mr AL-BUSAIDI (Oman) said that Oman looked forward to working constructively with its fellow Member States to achieve the objectives of the Agency's Statute, particularly the promotion of development through electricity generation, water desalination, harnessing of thermal energy, industrial, agricultural and medical applications, water resources management and protection of the environment. The Gulf Cooperation Council project concerning peaceful uses of nuclear energy was a regional initiative that served the same goals, and Oman itself had developed a corresponding national project to promote sustainable economic development. 
100. Immediately after becoming a member of the Agency in 2009, Oman had been visited by a factÂ­finding team of Secretariat staff members who had studied the countryÂs economic and social situation and development plans, the use of radioactive isotopes and radioactive sources, and the existing technical, legal and radiation safety infrastructure. The team had assessed OmanÂs nuclear application requirements in the light of the resulting data. Oman had subsequently submitted technical cooperation project requests relating to human health, energy planning and radiation safety to the Agency, basing the projects on its proposed long-term strategy and medium-term plan for peaceful uses of nuclear energy. 
101. Oman supported and encouraged the AgencyÂs partnerships with other United Nations specialized agencies, since its nuclear techniques could be applied in areas that fell within their competence. It had been particularly pleased to hear in May 2009 of the launching of the AgencyÂ­
WHO Joint Programme on Cancer Control, which provided for coordinated detection, diagnosis and treatment of the different types and stages of the disease. Oman hoped to benefit from the programme in view of the increasing prevalence of cancer throughout the world. He also noted with satisfaction that the FAO had cancelled its notice of withdrawal from the Joint FAO/IAEA Division of Nuclear Techniques in Food and Agriculture, a 45-year partnership that had promoted food security and the eradication of poverty, in accordance with the Millennium Development Goals. The Joint Division had made pioneering advances in the use of nuclear technology to increase crop yields, improve pest control and control infectious animal diseases. Oman urged all Member States, especially industrialized countries, to increase their investments in agricultural research and to make low-cost food widely available. 
102. Oman attached great importance to the AgencyÂs safety and security programme. More than 200 safety standard documents had been published since the publication in 1958 of a manual on the safe handling of radioisotopes, which had become an authoritative source of guidance for all Member States. Oman undertook to apply the AgencyÂs integrated radiation safety regime and to incorporate the relevant norms in its legislation. 
103. His country was also studying the AgencyÂs binding and non-binding legal instruments. He was pleased to announce that Oman had acceded on 8 August 2009 to the Early Notification and Assistance Conventions. 
104. All States bore full responsibility for ensuring nuclear safety and security. One positive sign and a source of optimism in that regard was the entry into force of the Pelindaba Treaty on 15 July 2009. Combined with other similar treaties covering South America, the South Pacific, South-East Asia and Antarctica, it turned the whole of the southern hemisphere into a nuclear-weapon-free zone. 
105. Other regions of the world had been less fortunate. Oman welcomed all recent initiatives aimed at nuclear disarmament in accordance with the provisions of the NPT. It called on the Agency and all countries in the Middle East to redouble their efforts to create a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the region, based on the AgencyÂs comprehensive safeguards regime. A prerequisite for any such step was the accession of all States in the region without exception to the NPT. It followed that Israel would be required to place its nuclear facilities under Agency safeguards and to accede to the NPT. Universal accession to the NPT by all countries in the Middle East and the application of comprehensive safeguards to all nuclear installations were also prerequisites for the convening by the Director General of a forum on a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the region. It would then be possible to draw up a clear-cut agenda to achieve the aims and ensure the success of the forum. 
106. Oman deeply appreciated the dedicated service and wise leadership of the outgoing Director General during his tenure. It welcomed the incoming Director General and wished him every success in his work. 
107. Mr SCOTTI (Italy) thanked the outgoing Director General for his work over the previous 12 years, and congratulated the Director General designate on his appointment. 
108. New legislation had been passed in Italy providing for the use of nuclear energy for power production. The Government had recently issued regulations concerning the establishment of new sites for nuclear power plants, and a nuclear safety agency had been set up, combining the structures of the nuclear department of the Higher Institute for Environmental Protection and Research with the resources of the Italian National Agency for New Technologies, Energy and the Environment. The new nuclear safety agency had been granted new authority in the fields of nuclear safety and security, and a national agency for new technologies, energy and sustainable economic development had been set up. The new institutional framework would facilitate cooperation with the Agency at a time when the Italian nuclear industry was forging strategic alliances with major partners abroad. 
109. In 2009, Italy had chaired the G8 Summit at L'Aquila, which had seen the adoption of a statement on non-proliferation that called upon all States to take further action in line with the three pillars of the NPT. The statement expressed support for the AgencyÂs work and a commitment to pursuing universal acceptance of the comprehensive safeguards agreement and the additional protocol as the verification standard. In that connection, Italy had recently made a financial contribution to the AgencyÂs plan of action to promote the conclusion of safeguards agreements and additional protocols. 
110. The NPT remained the cornerstone of the non-proliferation regime and the foundation for promoting the peaceful use of nuclear energy and nuclear disarmament, and Italy supported universal adherence to that instrument. However, the peaceful use of nuclear energy was an inalienable right of all States Parties; such a principle was absolutely unquestionable. At the same time, compliance and effective verification would not hinder the use of nuclear energy, but would facilitate its safe and secure development as an energy source. Agency safeguards were an essential tool for the effective implementation of the NPT and its non-proliferation objectives. Italy was committed to pursuing a safer world for all that was free of nuclear weapons, in accordance with the goals of the NPT. 
111. The next NPT Review Conference in 2010 would provide an important opportunity to enhance non-proliferation commitments, and to promote the peaceful use of nuclear energy and disarmament. Common political will was needed in order to set realistic and achievable goals and strengthen the three pillars of the NPT, which were mutually reinforcing. One common goal was to ensure that sensitive technologies and goods were disseminated exclusively for peaceful purposes. In that regard, Italy encouraged the AgencyÂs work on multilateral approaches to the nuclear fuel cycle, including assurances of nuclear fuel supply, as an effective means of addressing increased demand for nuclear fuel services while taking account of the global interest in minimizing the risk of proliferation. Italy welcomed the initiative to establish a nuclear fuel bank administered by the Agency. 
112. Safeguards were an essential tool to ensure compliance with non-proliferation objectives, and he commended the AgencyÂs verification activities in particular in the DPRK, Iran and Syria. It was regrettable that the most recent report by the Director General on the application of safeguards in Iran had confirmed IranÂs failure to comply with relevant Security Council resolutions. Although some progress had been made in clarifying certain aspects of IranÂs nuclear programme, the Agency remained unable to provide credible assurance about the absence of undeclared nuclear material and activities in Iran. Iran's inalienable right to pursue the development of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes came with a responsibility to restore confidence in the exclusively peaceful nature of its nuclear activities. Italy therefore urged Iran to comply fully with the resolutions of the Security Council, to implement its additional protocol and to cooperate fully with the Agency. 
113. The situation in DPRK was cause for serious concern. The countryÂs recent nuclear test had been a flagrant violation of Security Council resolutions and posed a threat to peace and stability in the region and beyond. The DPRK should comply fully with the relevant Security Council resolutions and its safeguards obligations, and should return to the six-party talks without preconditions and as a matter of urgency. Italy firmly supported the AgencyÂs fundamental role in verifying the DPRKÂs compliance with its international obligations. 
114. Every country intending to embark on a nuclear programme should give absolute priority to nuclear safety and security, and he highlighted the importance of the AgencyÂs safety standards in that regard. Italy welcomed the adoption by the European Commission of a new nuclear safety directive and the agreement between the European Union and the Agency on a new instrument for nuclear safety cooperation. It also welcomed initiative of the President of the United States to convene a global nuclear security summit in March 2010. 
115. Italy appreciated new initiatives concerning education and training in the nuclear field and capacity building. The Italian Presidency of the G8 was organizing an international workshop on nuclear safety and security to be held in Bologna in October 2009. ItalyÂs universities and health institutions ran cooperation programmes, particularly in the field of nuclear medicine, which provided for a large number of scientific visits and fellowships in Italy. 
116. Italy contributed 85% of the budget of the International Centre for Theoretical Physics in Trieste, which worked in close cooperation with the Agency and UNESCO to promote international cooperation among scientists from all countries of the world. The Centre was contributing significantly to the achievement of the MDGs and had trained more than 100 000 scientists from many countries, especially developing countries, over the previous 40 years. 
117. Mr MAGAUOV (Kazakhstan) said that his delegation supported the Director GeneralÂs balanced and professional approach to finding solutions to issues concerning the peaceful use of nuclear energy and non-proliferation. The risk of nuclear weapons proliferation was one of the greatest challenges to international security and stability, particularly in view of the threat that terrorists might acquire WMD. 
118. Kazakhstan continued to take an active role in the international cooperation in the field of nuclear disarmament, non-proliferation and response to international terrorism, religious extremism and other contemporary threats. Kazakhstan had ratified the International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism and called on those States that had not yet done so to accede to that instrument as soon as possible. His country fully supported Security Council resolution 1540 (2004), and was taking steps towards further strengthening its control mechanisms to counter illegal trafficking of nuclear and other radioactive materials, including prevention of the illicit transfer of nuclear technologies. KazakhstanÂs national export control policy fully complied with all universally accepted norms. As a member of the NSG, Kazakhstan took all the measures necessary to fulfil its obligations in order to strengthen the non-proliferation regime. 
119. The international community must have the assurance that nuclear technologies and expertise were used exclusively for peaceful purposes. For more than 50 years, the Agency had been bringing together the efforts of its Member States to promote the exclusively peaceful use of atomic energy for the benefit of mankind, ensuring nuclear safety and security, and precluding any chance of diverting achievements in the nuclear area for military use. The AgencyÂs undoubted successes called for the appreciation and universal recognition of all Member States. 
120. Kazakhstan supported the AgencyÂs efforts to assist States in achieving the highest possible nuclear security and physical protection standards, and in building capacities to prevent the diversion and theft of nuclear material. He reiterated the importance of the Global Threat Reduction Initiative in the context of securing vulnerable nuclear and radioactive materials at civil facilities around the world. 
121. His country called on all States to ensure the universality of Agency safeguards agreements and the additional protocol. It also encouraged those States that had not yet done so to sign and ratify the CTBT so that it could enter into force. 
122. Shortly after its independence, Kazakhstan had taken a number of concrete steps highlighting its determination to strengthen the non-proliferation regime and international security, including its accession to the NPT as a non-nuclear-weapon State. Closure of the Semipalatinsk test site had also signalled KazakhstanÂs support for non-proliferation, disarmament and the objectives of the CTBT. Furthermore, his country, which aspired to a vision of a nuclear-free world, had been instrumental in establishing the NWFZ in Central Asia, and trusted that other nuclear-weapon-free zones would be established in other regions of the world. Kazakhstan had called on the United Nations to declare 29 
August Â the day when the Semipalatinsk test site had been definitively shut down Â as the world day of renunciation of weapons of mass destruction. 
123. The Agency was a leading global forum for scientific and technological cooperation in the peaceful use of nuclear technology. Its activities facilitating the transfer and development of nuclear technologies and expertise in relation to all peaceful applications, including nuclear power and the nuclear fuel cycle, deserved support, and its work in developing human resources and capacityÂ­building in the area of nuclear science and technology was of great relevance to Kazakhstan. 
124. His country attached considerable importance to the joint declaration adopted by the participants in an international forum on uranium tailings in Central Asia that had taken place in June 2009 in Geneva and had been attended by representatives of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, the UNDP, the Agency, the OSCE, the EU, the EBRD and the Eurasian Economic Community. While the countries of Central Asia were making efforts to implement international programmes, the region required additional technical, financial and human resources to be capable of managing and maintaining the safety of areas contaminated with uranium tailings. 
125. In May 2009 Kazakhstan had, with Agency support, hosted an international conference on remediation of land contaminated by radioactive material residues. The conference had focused on strengthening international cooperation, promoting international standards, increasing international awareness and exchanging views. Its outcome had been important in strengthening partnerships and improving coordination of efforts. 
126. Kazakhstan was a major producer of uranium ore, possessed nuclear fuel production capacity and intended to increase its role in the peaceful use of atomic energy under the NPT and the Agency. It supported the proposal by the Director General for an international nuclear fuel bank under Agency auspices. He stressed that LEU deposited in such a bank should be under the full control of the Agency and in its legal possession. He also emphasized that the introduction of international control instruments to guarantee security of supply should not prejudice the rights of Member States to develop their own production capacity. Kazakhstan agreed that any mechanism should not be politicized or used with discrimination and should be accessible to all States that were in compliance with their safeguards agreements. Kazakhstan, as a signatory to the NPT and a State that had voluntarily given up nuclear armament, would be prepared to consider hosting any prospective Agency fuel bank on its territory. 
127. His country was committed to continuing to develop its technical cooperation activities with the Agency, and would continue to pay its contributions to the TCF and the regular budget. 
128. Kazakhstan supported the policy of strengthening export control mechanisms suggested by the NSG in relation to facilities and equipment used to enrich uranium and reprocess spent fuel. In view of its intention to develop its nuclear power sector further, his country recognized the need to enhance implementation efforts under INPRO and noted that a vertically-integrated company with a full nuclear fuel cycle was being established in Kazakhstan. 
129. He expressed his countryÂs appreciation of the outgoing Director GeneralÂs endeavours to strengthen the Agency and enhance its international authority, and for his tireless efforts to promote the peaceful and safe use of atomic energy. Kazakhstan fully supported the Director General designate, and wished him every success. 
130. Mr GHARIBABADI (Islamic Republic of Iran), exercising his right of reply, said that since the representative of Israel, a State not party to the NPT, had made false allegations about Iran, he joined other speakers in expressing serious concerns about Israel's nuclear programme. It was shameful that a State with a record of atrocities and aggression that possessed a nuclear weapons programme and had 
violated various United Nations Security Council resolutions was recommending compliance with Security Council resolutions and NPT obligations. Stability could not be achieved in the Middle East as long as IsraelÂs nuclear weapons posed a threat to its neighbours. Israel had refused to sign the NPT or implement an Agency safeguards agreement and relevant resolutions despite international demands. The international community, including the General Conference, must deal urgently with the Israeli threat.

8. 	General debate and Annual Report for 2008 (continued) (GC(53)/7) 

1. Mr DJELIC (Serbia) said that his country had been fortunate to host a visit by Mr Elbaradei in July 2009 which had marked the successful repatriation of Serbian spent nuclear fuel and had raised general awareness of the importance of nuclear technologies and their development in the future. 

2. Serbia remained committed to all the AgencyÂs fundamental principles and goals relating to safe and secure applications of nuclear energy for the benefit of human society and in accordance with global international standards and practices. It would continue to support efforts to strengthen and develop an integrated safeguards regime in accordance with the NPT and commended the Secretariat on its implementation of safeguards agreements and additional protocols. During Mr ElBaradeiÂs visit in July 2009, his country had signed an additional protocol. 

3. The Serbian Government attached great importance to nuclear security issues and was committed to strengthening its national nuclear security, and to international cooperation in that area. With assistance from the Agency and other international actors, Serbia was making progress in upgrading its capabilities for combating illicit trafficking, improving its physical protection system and implementing measures for gaining control over orphan sources. Only with an efficient nuclear security system in place in all countries, and through strong international cooperation, could the threat of nuclear terrorism be countered globally. 

4. His country had accelerated its decommissioning efforts and its work on the repatriation of spent nuclear fuel with a view to removing the Vin?a Institute of Nuclear Sciences from the list of potential global threats. Progress was being made through national efforts and with international support, one of the important steps having been realized in June 2009 when Serbia had signed the necessary intergovernmental agreement with the Russian Federation. A further major step, the signing of a foreign trade contract, had been accomplished during the current General Conference. In addition to strong national efforts, it had been the support of the Secretariat that had allowed those major steps to be accomplished successfully and on time. The repatriation effort would be one of the largest of its kind ever conducted, involving 2.3 t of material, and it was planned to be completed by the end of 2010. He thanked all international donors, in particular the United States of America, the European Union, the Russian Federation, the Czech Republic, the Nuclear Threat Initiative and Slovenia, and reaffirmed SerbiaÂs commitment to covering at least half of the costs for decommissioning. 

5. Serbia had also carried out significant internal restructuring in order to ensure the efficient accomplishment of the repatriation and decommissioning, and to meet international norms. In July 2009, it had founded a public company which would assume control of and responsibility for the management of all nuclear liabilities and assets throughout the country, including all those involved in the Vin?a Institute Nuclear Decommissioning programme. That Institute, which had a long tradition in nuclear science and multidisciplinary research, would coexist with the new public company and conduct its activities as one of SerbiaÂs leading research institutions. 

6. The AgencyÂs nuclear and radiation safety activities were of great importance and his country was committed to strengthening further its nuclear legal system to protect both society and the environment from potential risks and to ensure that nuclear energy was applied for the benefit of future generations. Although applications of nuclear energy were already covered by an array of national legal instruments, to make the legal framework more comprehensive and comply with 
international safety standards and practices, and in view of SerbiaÂs position as a future European Union member State, Serbia had adopted a new law on radiation protection and nuclear safety in May 2009. The new law provided a basis for the establishment of an independent regulatory authority which would be responsible for radiation protection, nuclear safety and radioactive waste management. The new authority would provide better and more extensive regulatory control, would develop a new set of by-laws and would track their implementation; it should be operational by the end of the year. It would also ensure that all operations, practices and activities, including the Vin?a Institute Nuclear Decommissioning programme, were carried out with the highest possible level of safety. 
7. Serbia strongly supported further improvement of Agency technical cooperation and was grateful for the assistance it had received with restoring and upgrading its nuclear technologies. The support of the Agency was indispensable for countries in transition, particularly countries like Serbia that had suffered a loss of human resources in the nuclear field. His country hoped that the Agency would continue to improve its activities, working with it not only on existing programmes, but also in applying nuclear technologies in such civil sectors as human health, agriculture, veterinary medicine, water resources management and preservation of cultural heritage. Serbia had recently signed a new CPF covering the period up to 2015. 

8. Finally, he noted that Serbia had, as usual, met all its financial obligations to the Agency in a timely fashion and would continue to do so in the future. 

9. Mr STEINMANN (Switzerland) said that, since the preceding General Conference, there had been encouraging signs in the field of nuclear disarmament, in particular: the commitment made by the Presidents of the United States and the Russian Federation on 1 April 2009 to achieving a nuclear-free world, which had been followed by the signing of the Joint Understanding for the START follow-on treaty in July 2009; the constructive atmosphere surrounding the work of the third session of the Preparatory Committee for the 2010 NPT Review Conference held in May 2009 in New York; and the acceptance, on 29 May 2009, of the work programme of the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva, which had restored the confidence of the international community in multilateral mechanisms. Those developments should be followed closely, particularly since some of them could have interesting implications for the Agency. 

10. Where regional issues were concerned, developments had unfortunately not been as satisfactory. In the area of nuclear verification, there were still many uncertainties and indications that nuclear programmes could have a military dimension. It was therefore important that the Agency be able to carry out all the required verification activities. Switzerland saw no way out of the crises in question other than diplomacy, which was why his country called on all parties concerned to seize the opportunities offered to them, even if they did not immediately meet their expectations. 

11. Switzerland appreciated the discussions in progress concerning the future of the Agency. Although a conclusion was some way off, the opportunity to discuss freely and openly questions that were of concern to all enabled Member States to understand each otherÂs points of view better and thus improve their ability to find compromises where necessary. 

12. The issue of multilateral approaches to the nuclear fuel cycle had provoked intense discussion. Since the report of the Agency expert group, published in 2005, work on the issue had been overshadowed by a certain malaise. Such discussions should never lead to attempts by States in possession of sensitive nuclear technologies to curb the technological progress of States without such technology on the pretext of combating nuclear proliferation. The free use of nuclear technology, in accordance with the inalienable rights provided for in the NPT, must not be called into question. For many, the main motive of those initiatives was economic considerations. It was true that the exception 
granted to India by the NSG in August 2008 had undermined confidence in the notion of a fair nonÂ­proliferation system and had tainted discussions with concern over double standards. Moreover, in the absence of real progress in the field of nuclear disarmament, there was the risk that those discussions would always be seen as premature by many non-nuclear-weapon States. Consequently, Switzerland supported any initiative which would reassure the latter as to their rights. 
13. His country was satisfied with the accounts for 2008 and the External AuditorÂs report. On a number of occasions in recent years, Switzerland had asked that efforts be made to ensure that all expenditures be included in the Regular Budget and, after various exceptions, it expected future budget increases to be limited to offsetting inflation both as regards the Regular Budget and the technical cooperation budget. The budget for 2010, which had been accepted by consensus, had not shown any real improvement in that respect. However, the creation of a fund for major investments marked a first step towards the development of a modern and transparent policy for the management of property and the essential equipment. That fund should now be incorporated in the Regular Budget so that it properly reflected a shared commitment funded by all and not just a handful of States. Switzerland also noted the decision to establish a working group charged with the task of proposing a budget for 2011 on the basis of priorities still to be defined, in which it was ready to take an active and committed part. His country attached great importance to the inclusion in the Regular Budget of all costs and investments related to the statutory tasks of the Agency, and to rigorous planning. 

14. His country also gave high priority to the AgencyÂs promotional activities and efforts in the area of technical cooperation. Payment of contributions had been satisfactory and, as a result, interest in the AgencyÂs programme remained intact despite the financial crisis affecting the economies of many States. Switzerland fully endorsed the application of NPCs and CPFs, which were important factors in ensuring the efficient implementation of the technical cooperation programme and enabling the Agency to make a more useful contribution to the achievement of Millennium Development Goals. 

15. Switzerland was satisfied with the annual report on the application of safeguards, in particular the fact that the Agency had concluded that, within the group of States with comprehensive safeguards agreements in force, nuclear material had remained in civilian use. His country called on all States party to the NPT that had not brought comprehensive safeguards agreements into force to do so. With regard to integrated safeguards, he asked the Secretariat to focus on analysis of the reduction in overall costs their progressive application would entail both for the Agency and the countries concerned, recalling that reduction of verification costs had been one of the declared purposes of the introduction of the additional protocol. Like other countries, Switzerland would like to receive from the Department of Safeguards a proposal to focus verification efforts on facilities with nuclear material that posed a major proliferation risk. 

16. It would be useful if the Agency were to recall and clarify its role and responsibilities in the areas of safety and security, and the roles and responsibilities of the host State of a nuclear installation or its owner. Such distinctions were not always clear to the public, and it would be undesirable if false expectations were to be created regarding the AgencyÂs role. 

17. Turning finally to nuclear energy developments in Switzerland, he said that the road map for the creation of depositories in deep geological strata had been accepted in 2008 by his countryÂs Government following consultations with the parties concerned at home and abroad. The road map was now being progressively applied. Switzerland had five nuclear power plants, the oldest of which had been in operation for forty years, and it was envisaged that the three oldest plants would be decommissioned after fifty yearsÂ service. The issue of their replacement thus had to be considered. A referendum would be held, probably after 2012, to elicit the publicÂs approval to build new plants. To date, SwitzerlandÂs five nuclear power plants had generated 750 000 million kW.h of electricity, 
corresponding savings in CO2 generation of some 600 Mt, or more than 15 years of SwitzerlandÂs total carbon dioxide emissions. 
18. He concluded by thanking the Secretariat and the Director General for the high quality of their work and their dedication to the AgencyÂs fundamental objectives. He emphasized his countryÂs admiration for the independence and courage the Director General had shown over the preceding twelve years. 

19. Mr ALEINIK (Belarus) said that, for some years, the Agency had been witnessing increasing interest in nuclear power. A large number of countries, including his own, had announced their intention of starting up a nuclear power programme and building their first nuclear power plants. At past General Conferences, Belarus had outlined its views on that issue and announced the decision taken by its authorities to build a nuclear power plant. It had made substantial progress in dealing with many of the fundamental issues and in creating the necessary infrastructure. The regulatory infrastructure, which was being built up from virtually nothing, would ultimately comprise some 120 instruments formulated in accordance with international requirements. One law on the utilization of atomic energy had recently been adopted in 2008. 

20. Emphasis was being placed on developing an effective regulatory system for nuclear and radiation safety. A department had been set up with the responsibility for licensing at all stages of the construction and operation of a nuclear power plant, performing inspections, formulating safety regulations and criteria and protecting the environment and human health. Extensive work had been done on selecting a site for the future nuclear power plant. Following careful and comprehensive studies of potential locations, three had been identified, one as a priority and the others as back-ups. The Agency had been assisting with the selection process and two expert missions had been sent to Belarus in the preceding year. 

21. One very high priority was developing the necessary staffing and scientific potential in the nuclear power field. The Government had adopted two programmes in that connection, one of which called for the establishment of new fields of specialization in the nuclear power field in a number of universities in the country, under which instruction had already begun in 2008. Training courses and study placements in foreign educational institutions and operational nuclear power plants were also planned. 

22. Public information was also being accorded major attention. The Government had approved regulations for the discussion of issues relating to the use of atomic energy with the participation of State associations, other organizations and the public. That document set out the functions and responsibilities of State authorities, local authorities and operators in that respect. Reports and environmental impact assessments on the projected use of atomic energy had to be open to public discussion. 

23. An environmental impact assessment for the planning and construction of the nuclear power plant was currently in preparation. In August, brief summary information had been sent to the States that had announced their intention to participate in the procedure: Austria, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Ukraine. Any comments those countries and the public might have would be taken into account in the final version of the report. 

24. His Government was engaging in active international cooperation to implement the nuclear power plant construction project. An intergovernmental agreement had been signed in 2009 between Belarus and the Russian Federation on cooperation in the use of atomic energy for peaceful purposes. That framework document established the main spheres of cooperation, namely planning, construction, operation, supply of nuclear fuel, nuclear and radiation safety, scientific cooperation and 
staff training. A similar intergovernmental agreement had already been signed between Belarus and China. 
25. Implementing such a major project as the establishment of a nuclear power programme would be impossible without the involvement of the Agency, the leading international organization in the nuclear field. His countryÂs interaction with the Agency on a whole range of matters related to that project had been most productive. Belarus would like to see the Agency play an even stronger role in helping States that had decided to set up a national nuclear power programme. Recently, an understanding had developed within the Agency regarding the need for a comprehensive approach to providing assistance to States that were setting up a nuclear programme. In view of the growing number of such States, it was logical and appropriate that the Agency should have a means of providing integrated appraisals and assistance in that regard. The key factor was an appropriate infrastructure that met existing international standards. Systematic expert and technical support from the Agency was needed to develop such infrastructure. The AgencyÂs new INIR service, which was of interest to his country, was intended to provide such assistance and it should have a significant impact on the establishment of new nuclear power programmes and on the safe use of nuclear power worldwide. 
26. Belarus was an active participant in the AgencyÂs technical cooperation programme. BelarusÂs priorities were the development of a national nuclear power infrastructure, environmental protection, rehabilitation of land contaminated by the Chernobyl accident, and health. All the technical cooperation projects being implemented focused on important socio-economic problems. Assistance was being provided with the introduction of nuclear power, including training of personnel and the development of a national nuclear safety regulatory system. Belarus intended to continue its active collaboration with the Agency in the rehabilitation of areas contaminated by the Chernobyl accident. Cooperation in that field was in line with the United Nations Chernobyl strategy, which envisaged transition of the affected regions to sustainable socio-economic development. Belarus expected that the Agency would be actively involved in implementing the United Nations Chernobyl action plan. 
27. His country consistently supported the strengthening and expansion of the AgencyÂs technical cooperation programme, and making its funding more predictable and assured. In that connection, it was pleased to note the continuing positive trend in the funding situation for the programme thanks to the coordinated efforts of Member States and the Secretariat. For its part, Belarus had for several years paid its voluntary contributions to the TCF in full and on time. It pledged to pay its 2010 contribution in full and called on all Member States to follow that example. 
28. Work at national level to ensure nuclear and radiation safety was an inseparable part of the AgencyÂs general efforts to maintain a global safety regime. Belarus supported the activities of the Agency and its Secretariat in that field and, as a State which had taken the decision to construct its first nuclear power plant, it accorded great attention to nuclear safety issues. In that connection, it noted the importance of universal adherence to and effective implementation of the most important international legal instruments in that field, above all the Convention on Nuclear Safety and the Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management. The review meetings pursuant to those two conventions bore witness to the fulfilment by Member States of their obligations. Since more and more States were announcing plans to establish a nuclear power programme, the early achievement of universal adherence to such instruments took on even greater importance. In addition, the processes under the aforementioned instruments confirmed the interconnection between the prospective growth of nuclear power and increased attention to nuclear safety issues. Ensuring the necessary level of safety and the security of nuclear facilities, and proper management of nuclear waste, was a key element in any StateÂs nuclear power programme. In that context, international legal instruments and the AgencyÂs safety standards had an even greater role to play. 
29. Belarus was committed to the international processes aimed at achieving nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation. It attached great importance to strengthening the AgencyÂs safeguards system. Proof of its commitment to the principles of non-proliferation of nuclear weapons was its rigorous compliance with its obligations under the NPT and its safeguards agreement. 
30. When considering non-proliferation and disarmament as a whole, it was worth remembering that one of the most important aims was to ensure that nuclear technology was used exclusively for peaceful purposes. In that connection he stressed that, under the NPT and the AgencyÂs Statute, every Member State had the inalienable right to pursue peaceful nuclear activities. Existing international mechanisms should promote equal and non-discriminatory access for all interested countries to the benefits of nuclear energy. 
31. As one of the founding members of the Agency, Belarus consistently advocated the strengthening of the Agency as the leading international organization promoting the safe, reliable and peaceful use of nuclear energy for sustainable development. A great deal had been done in recent years to achieve the AgencyÂs main goal of Atoms for Peace, and much of that could be attributed to its Director General. He expressed sincere gratitude to Mr ElBaradei for his tireless efforts as Director General, which had significantly enhanced the AgencyÂs international authority. 
32. In conclusion, he said that Belarus gave a positive assessment of the AgencyÂs activities over the preceding year and proposed that the Annual Report be approved. 
33. Mr BORGES (Angola) welcomed the progress described in the Annual Report for 2008 and expressed appreciation for the ongoing partnership between the Agency and FAO, assisting African countries in their efforts to eradicate tsetse flies and trypanosomosis, and for the AgencyÂs support for application of nuclear technology in the agricultural sector, which had contributed significantly to reducing poverty. He also commended the AgencyÂs efforts to help Member States fight cancer and expressed regret at the scarcity of institutions in Africa equipped for PET. He called on the Secretariat to strengthen cooperation with governments in order to build institutional and human capacity in that sphere. 
34. Angola attached great importance to the safeguards system, not only owing to the growing interest among Member States in access to nuclear energy but also because of the need to ensure safe management. Having access to nuclear energy and using it to promote development were the right of all Member States, but that right must be exercised within the framework of the AgencyÂs Statute. 
35. For the large number of developing Member States, particularly in Africa, one of the greatest benefits of Agency membership was the technical cooperation programme, which had made a fundamental contribution to development in various economic sectors. He expressed appreciation for the AgencyÂs continued support to his country, within the framework of its CPF, to promote and develop nuclear technology and science, including through training of personnel and the supply of equipment and experts. Considerable progress had been made. 
36. Angola was firmly committed to improving control over activities involving ionizing radiation through monitoring of occupational doses, inspection and authorization of the use of X ray equipment, and authorization of the import of radiation sources for use in industrial gamma radiography. Twelve projects were under way in such areas as education, human resources development, agriculture, environment and health. Under AFRA, it was hoped that 14 more projects would be approved as soon as possible. Five Agency missions had visited Angola during 2009 to assess the implementation of ongoing projects, identify projects of national and regional scope, and formulate an action plan for 2009Â2011 with particular emphasis on revision of legislation, preparation of regulations and guidelines, and recruitment and training of staff for the regulatory body created in 2008. 
37. He expressed satisfaction at the results of the negotiations on the programme and budget for 2010Â2011 and welcomed the rational management of financial resources and the creation of the major capital investment fund. He also welcomed the alignment of the TCF cycle with the Regular Budget cycle as of 2012. Angola had fulfilled its financial obligations to the Agency and had contributed to the TCF. He called on other Member States to strengthen their financial support for the Agency. 
38. Mr KARIMOV (Azerbaijan) said the world was witnessing a renaissance in nuclear power and an ever growing number of States was expressing an interest in developing nuclear energy programmes, prompted by increasing demands for environmental protection and problems of energy security and fluctuating oil prices. StatesÂ efforts to ensure sustainable energy supplies Â a matter of fundamental importance for economic development and the well-being of the population Â could not be impeded by any discriminatory mechanisms. However, as the number of countries with nuclear power facilities increased, so did the risk of proliferation. In that connection, Azerbaijan highly valued the AgencyÂs efforts to prevent the proliferation or diversion of nuclear technology for military purposes. However, the best way of ensuring the peaceful nature of nuclear technology was to strengthen further international peace, security and stability. 
39. In keeping with its commitments, and in cooperation with the Agency, Azerbaijan was gradually implementing a strategy aimed at the use of nuclear energy exclusively for peaceful purposes and at preventing the spread of weapons of mass destruction. Reflecting its readiness to cooperate with the international community and all States and international organizations, Azerbaijan was playing an active part in strengthening the nuclear security regime and was making its contribution to ensuring energy security in the Eurasian region through the supply of its national energy resources. However, all supply routes became vulnerable in the absence of peace and stability. Prolonged conflicts, aggressive separatist movements and the illegal occupation of foreign territories in the region constituted a great risk not only to the reliable supply of energy resources but also to the stable functioning of energy systems. 
40. The destructive policy of one State which had made territorial claims on its neighbours and occupied 20% of AzerbaijanÂs territory was not only prejudicial to regional stability but was also a challenge to the security of the international community. His country once again drew attention to the threat from the use of occupied and uncontrolled territories for illegal trafficking in nuclear and radioactive material or for nuclear and radiological terrorism. Such uncontrolled territories posed a grave threat, because they were outside the sphere of international law and were not accessible for appropriate and timely response. 
41. Recalling the AgencyÂs vital role in preventing nuclear proliferation, he stressed the need for further development of international cooperation within the framework of the organization to reduce the global threat of the use of nuclear and radioactive material for terrorist purposes, and he urged the Agency to ensure the universal implementation of its statutory verification functions in the area of non-proliferation, including in the territory of Azerbaijan occupied by Armenia. 
42. Azerbaijan greatly appreciated the work of the Secretariat in implementing the technical cooperation strategy and in ensuring that its technical cooperation programme was in keeping with the national priorities of Member States. Cooperating closely with the Agency, Azerbaijan received assistance in the areas of nuclear knowledge and technology, simultaneously improving and strengthening its radiation safety infrastructure. On 3 April 2009, Presidential decree No. 74 had approved legislation on a State agency for the regulation of nuclear and radiological activities. That agency, which had the role of the countryÂs regulatory body, employed 30 specialists who were working to improve existing legislation in the area of nuclear and radiological activities to ensure they met international standards. A regulatory programme had been formulated and regulatory and legal 
documents were being drafted. An inspection programme had been elaborated and an inventory of all ionizing radiation sources and nuclear material was being drawn up. 
43. The technical cooperation projects that were being implemented in Azerbaijan with the help of the Agency were aimed at addressing high-priority socio-economic problems. The country was taking part in 9 national, 32 regional and several interregional projects relating to the security of equipment, material and technological systems containing radioisotopes, improvement of the work of regulatory bodies responsible for nuclear and radiation safety, dissemination and application of nuclear knowledge, and training of scientific and technical experts in the area of safety and use of nuclear and radioactive material. His country was particularly grateful to the United States Department of Energy which, together with the Agency, was helping Azerbaijan ensure the physical protection of radioisotope facilities. 
44. Azerbaijan valued the AgencyÂs assistance in the area of research, exchange of scientific and technical information and support for training of scientific staff and experts in the use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. He thanked the Agency for the assistance provided in connection with a project on a feasibility study for the construction of a nuclear research facility. The Government of Azerbaijan had already allotted land for the reactor site and the requisite financing would be made available. The site would also accommodate a radiation facility for the sterilization of food products and medical materials, and the project would be implemented under the technical cooperation programme for 2009Â2011. 
45. He thanked the Agency for its help in providing the National Cancer Centre with modern nuclear medicine equipment for the diagnosis and treatment of oncological complaints. Work was being stepped up and, over the coming two years, it was planned to introduce additional equipment, including a linear accelerator and a BrainLab unit. 
46. Promotion of nuclear knowledge and the availability of trained staff for peaceful nuclear applications was a priority for his country. It endorsed the AgencyÂs efforts to elaborate a comprehensive methodology and guidelines for management of nuclear knowledge and was prepared to contribute actively to the development of a nuclear education network. 
47. The Government of Azerbaijan greatly appreciated the AgencyÂs assistance in implementing technical cooperation projects and had every intention of meeting its commitments in that regard. 
48. Ms GONZÃLEZ (Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela) reiterated her countryÂs commitment to the principles laid down in the Charter of the United Nations and the AgencyÂs Statute. Defence of State sovereignty and self-determination of peoples, as well as renunciation of the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State, were essential for the preservation of international peace and security. The Venezuelan Constitution reflected the countryÂs pacifist conviction and explicitly stated that the State would prohibit the manufacture and use of weapons of mass destruction and promote nuclear disarmament. 
49. Venezuela appreciated the AgencyÂs efforts to promote the use of nuclear energy in areas such as food security, agriculture, health, water resources management and environmental protection and urged it to strengthen them. It accorded high priority to the development of integration among the States of Latin America and the Caribbean, strengthening of South-South relations and promotion of solidarity among peoples. ARCAL and the Agency could help achieve those aims by espousing cooperation, solidarity and peaceful coexistence instead of discriminatory political criteria. 
50. She stressed the importance of the transfer of technology and knowledge relating to the use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes to developing countries by means of training in line with national priorities and objectives. The resulting enhancement of scientific and technological capacities would 
effectively contribute to social and economic development. Her country firmly rejected attempts to apply trade practices or other mechanisms designed to monopolize or even impede access to nuclear technology and knowledge, especially to developing countries. 
51. Her country had established a high-level commission to develop cooperation in the use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes, including enhancement of activities being conducted with the Agency, in the conviction that such efforts were consistent with the development priorities established by the Government in the SimÃ³n Bolivar National Project Â First Socialist Plan 2007Â2013. 
52. The Venezuelan National Assembly had recently approved the Convention on Early Notification of a Nuclear Accident and it was hoped that the corresponding instrument of ratification would shortly be deposited. 
53. Her country was convinced of the need to build a multipolar world in which all peoples and not just the most powerful nations had a voice. The global balance of power had been shifting in recent years and multilateral bodies should keep abreast of the new political circumstances. 
54. It was disturbing that some countries were implementing military doctrines that contemplated the threat of use or use of nuclear weapons. Moreover, they had been developing more sophisticated weapons in breach of their disarmament and non-proliferation commitments, undermining prospects of achieving lasting peace. Venezuela had ratified the Tlatelolco Treaty, which had made Latin America and the Caribbean into the worldÂs first nuclear-weapon-free zone. It was a party to the NPT, had ratified the CTBT and had defended the principles of disarmament and non-proliferation in international forums, since it was convinced that the eradication of such weapons was the most effective way of dealing with the threats posed by their existence. Support for the early entry into force of the CTBT would promote security for the peoples of the world and would check the development of new nuclear weapons. 
55. The NPT, which was recognized by all as the cornerstone of the disarmament and nonÂ­proliferation regime, was still under considerable pressure. The fight against terrorism was being used as a pretext for the development and production of more destructive nuclear weapons, nuclear agreements were being signed with States that were not parties to the Treaty, and the existence of military nuclear programmes that were not subject to Agency supervision was being ignored, while other countries were cynically hounded for seeking to exercise their inalienable right to have access to nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. Venezuela therefore urged the nuclear-weapon States to make a political commitment to disarmament and non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, thus sending a clear message to the world that the 2010 NPT Review Conference should achieve that goal. 
56. Action in support of nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation should be taken multilaterally, simultaneously and in a non-discriminatory manner. Her country rejected the suggestion that some countriesÂ nuclear weapons posed no threat, while those allegedly possessed by other States placed the world in mortal danger. In that connection, she recalled that an attack or threat of attack on nuclear facilities that were operational or under construction undermined the climate of peace and trust that should prevail in international relations and seriously threatened the survival of human beings and the environment. Venezuela strongly objected to the classic expression of imperialist principles known as preventive war, justifying attacks on sovereign States on the grounds of unproven presumed threats. It therefore supported the draft resolution on prohibition of armed attack or threat of attack against nuclear installations, during operation or under construction. 
57. Venezuela had consistently supported initiatives aimed at establishing a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East, including the resolution submitted to the current session of the General Conference, since that would contribute effectively to peace and stability in the region. It was essential that Israel, the only State in the region which possessed nuclear weapons and which was not a party to 
the NPT, join the majority of countries throughout the world by acceding to the Treaty and placing its nuclear installations under Agency safeguards, a matter that had become more urgent since the Israeli GovernmentÂs public acknowledgement that it possessed nuclear weapons. Her country supported the proposed resolution on Israeli nuclear capabilities, since the application of discriminatory practices and double standards in that regard was unacceptable. Requiring some countries to meet their obligations while others were exempt violated the principle of the legal equality of States. 
58. Her country acknowledged the efforts made by the Iranian Government to close the nuclear file opened against it once and for all. The work plan agreed between Iran and the Agency, which foresaw a return to routine application of safeguards to that countryÂs nuclear installations, had been implemented. The Agency had found no evidence that IranÂs nuclear programme was anything other than peaceful. Venezuela therefore called for an end to the threats and harassment from a group of countries which, in order to justify their imperialist, geopolitical and commercial ambitions in the region, had maintained a smear campaign in the media not only against Iran but even against the Agency. 
59. It should be remembered that the farcical allegations regarding the existence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq had led to the cruel and illegal invasion of that country, in breach of the spirit of the Charter of the United Nations and international law, and notwithstanding the outcry of the international community. The people of the United States, like all other peoples, had always been rigorous in requiring that their rulers abide by the truth. There had never been any such weapons, and yet Iraq had been bombed and occupied, and remained under occupation. 
60. In the case of Iran, that privileged group of countries had pushed a series of resolutions through the United Nations Security Council, thus assuming de facto Â though not de jure Â competencies which belonged solely to the Agency. Such interference undermined the AgencyÂs credibility and independence. The Agency was the only body with the technical competence to deal with such matters. 
61. Her country strongly condemned the bombardment of alleged nuclear installations within Syrian territory in September 2007, which constituted a violation of SyriaÂs sovereignty and territorial integrity. 
62. The question of assured supply mechanisms raised a number of disturbing economic, financial and national security issues. The imposition of politically discriminatory practices that violated StatesÂ inalienable right to develop nuclear energy for peaceful purposes could not be ruled out. Those concerns had not been addressed by the countries proposing such mechanisms. 
63. Venezuela upheld the right of developing countries to secure the technology and knowledge that would enable them to include the use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes in their development plans. It advocated a strengthening of the role of developing countries, and Venezuela in particular, in the design and implementation of programmes of cooperation and action of multilateral bodies such as the Agency with a view to achieving that goal. 
64. Mr VALLIM GUERREIRO (Brazil) said that the Agency was entering a new era with the departure of Mr ElBaradei and the election of his successor as Director General, Mr Amano. Mr ElBaradei had had to face challenges for which past history had not fully prepared the Agency. Yet he had always risen to the occasion, constantly reminding members that, instead of haggling over petty issues, it was necessary to develop a vision for the future, to transcend differences and to overcome misgivings. Equally, he had never wavered in his endeavours to convince members that, whatever their national agendas, all should submit to the rule of law. Indeed, one of the paramount lessons he had taught the Agency for the future was that, if it ceased to function as a rule-based organization, it 
would lose its relevance. Mr ElBaradei would be missed, but Brazil was confident that Mr Amano would make a great Director General and it looked forward to working closely with him. 
65. Apart from the change of Director General, there was a fresh wind in the world political landscape. There was room to hope that the vision of a world free of the deadliest weapons mankind had ever invented could be realized sooner rather than later. Brazil urged all countries that possessed nuclear weapons to commit themselves to the earliest possible elimination of their nuclear arsenals. The argument that, to rid the planet of nuclear weapons, absolute guarantees were necessary that no country would be in a position to develop them was understandable. To bring that about, verification measures would need to be strengthened to a level higher than that foreseen in the NPT, if possible making assurances of the absence of undeclared nuclear activities as foolproof as the assurances with respect to peaceful applications of declared activities. 
66. However, it was not fair to expect that countries that had already made unequivocal, credible and verifiable commitments to forswear nuclear weapons should implement further enhanced verification measures until the international community had before it, at least, some kind of time frame within which the objective of a world free of nuclear weapons could be expected to be achieved. Enhanced verification mechanisms should be devised and incorporated into a future convention on the prohibition of all nuclear weapons, which would level the playing field for all members of the international community. 
67. During the preceding year, the AgencyÂs Board of Governors had had productive and useful discussions of the issue of assurances of supply of low-enriched uranium. That had brought to light differences of opinion on how to approach that question. There was a lack of understanding of what the objective of the various proposals on the table was. One thing was clear: the exercise of an inalienable right could not be looked on with suspicion, provided, of course, that compliance with safeguards obligations was assured. Brazil saw merit in the idea advocated by many, including the Director General, that, ultimately, all enrichment and reprocessing activities should be placed under some kind of multilateral control. The modalities for achieving that goal could perhaps be enshrined in a future convention on the prohibition of nuclear weapons. 
68. As a founding member of the Agency, his country was fully and unflinchingly committed to the objectives of the organizationÂs Statute. It supported the AgencyÂs activities and highly appreciated its efforts in the field of nuclear power, other nuclear applications, safety, security, safeguards and Â last but not least Â technical cooperation. For the organization to be even more effective, it was essential to strive for a more balanced approach to the implementation of its core activities. That was particularly true in the face of a revival of interest in nuclear power, including in countries which were planning to use nuclear power for the first time. 
69. Applications of nuclear energy in the health field were also expanding as an ever growing number of countries availed themselves of nuclear techniques for diagnosis and therapy. PACT played an important role in that regard. Furthermore, new applications of nuclear energy in agriculture and hydrology had been developed and a growing number of countries were benefiting from them. 
70. The international community needed a strong Agency endowed with the necessary resources to carry out fully its statutory activities, to which goal Brazil was unequivocally committed. States needed to join forces to find the will and means to achieve their common goals: development, peace and security. 
71. Mr SHOOGUFAN (Afghanistan) said that Afghanistan had been one of the founder members of the Agency but its active involvement in technical cooperation programmes had been interrupted as a result of years of conflict and war. Since 2002, it had been seeking to regain its place on the political map and within international organizations. In 2004, it had signed a payment plan to settle its arrears 
to the Agency, and it was confident that the outstanding balance would shortly be paid off in its entirety. As a least developed country, Afghanistan continued to depend on the support of donor countries and required large-scale technical cooperation to foster its socio-economic development. His Government was convinced that the AgencyÂs technical cooperation activities would contribute substantially to the reconstruction of his war-torn country, and would help to improve the lives of the Afghan people. Transfer of nuclear technology to increase agricultural productivity and improve the provision of health services and potable water was crucial for his country. Currently 11 national projects and 31 regional or interregional projects involving Afghanistan were being implemented. His Government welcomed the AgencyÂs approach to the development of self-reliance with a view to increasing productivity and building capacity. It had established the Afghanistan High Atomic Energy Commission with a view to responding efficiently to the increasing number of Agency projects in the country. 
72. The Agency, in cooperation with the WHO, was capable of enhancing health care in many developing countries. Moreover, nuclear and isotopic techniques were instrumental in alleviating hardships caused by a shortage of potable water, hunger and disease. Radiation-induced mutation produced higher-yield, drought-resistant crops of better nutritional quality. The Agency and its Member States must seek to minimize the number of undernourished people, particularly children. 
73. Increased use of nuclear technology brought with it increased levels of responsibility, and he emphasized the importance of preventing the misuse, diversion and theft of nuclear material. Safeguards agreements between the Agency and its Member States, the development of SSACs, secure storage and waste management, and effective border controls were essential to prevent illicit trafficking in nuclear material. When safety and safeguards activities also served security purposes, additional funding should be provided from the Nuclear Security Fund to accelerate implementation and promote sustainability. However, Member StatesÂ contributions to the TCF should not be adversely affected by contributions to the Nuclear Security Fund. 
74. The strategic value of nuclear weapons in todayÂs world was declining. However, the dangers of proliferation must be seriously taken into account and the international community must continue its efforts in the area of nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation. He called for effective reductions of stockpiles and warheads and commended the positive steps taken recently by the United States and the Russian Federation to sign a Joint Understanding for the START follow-on treaty. His country trusted that other nations would follow that example and seek to reduce the number of nuclear weapons. It also noted with satisfaction that the Conference of Disarmament had agreed to negotiate a fissile material cut-off treaty and to discuss nuclear disarmament and security assurances for non-nuclearÂ­weapon States. Downsized nuclear arsenals should reduce the risk of nuclear accidents and free time and resources which could be used to support developing countries embarking on peaceful nuclear technology programmes. 
75. Mr BERNHARD (Denmark) said that the world would continue to depend on the Agency to prevent nuclear proliferation, for it was a dedicated, trusted and highly professional organization whose contribution was essential. Its inspection procedures served not only to verify the peaceful use of nuclear technologies but also enabled States to clear themselves of any suspicion of wrongdoing through full and unrestricted cooperation with the organization. However, the Agency could only be as effective as its tools allowed it to be. Some States had developed secret nuclear programmes even with comprehensive safeguards agreements in force. It was therefore important for all States to recognize that the current IAEA verification standard was a comprehensive safeguards agreement together with an additional protocol. 
76. The AgencyÂs non-proliferation efforts were part of a broader perspective, including the NPT, the United Nations Security Council, export controls and several other initiatives all serving to prevent 
the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery. The NPT was the cornerstone of those efforts and, in May 2009, there had been a noticeably improved atmosphere at the third and final session of the Preparatory Committee for the 2010 NPT Review Conference and a determination among participants that the Conference should have a constructive outcome and bring closer the prospect of a world without nuclear weapons. 
77. The Security Council also had a key responsibility for non-proliferation, and Denmark supported its increased attention to proliferation issues both generally and with respect to specific cases. The adoption of Security Council resolution 1540 (2004) had been a fundamental step forward in that respect. It was of the utmost importance that all States complied with their obligations as set forth in Security Council resolutions on specific issues. 
78. Denmark continued to support a consistent approach in the Security Council process. The latest report by the Director General on Iran had concluded that that country had neither implemented the additional protocol nor cooperated with the Agency over the remaining issues of concern which needed to be clarified to exclude the possibility of military dimensions to its nuclear programme. Denmark shared the serious concern expressed by the Director General and urged Iran to take the steps required by the Board of Governors and the Security Council in order to create confidence in the exclusively peaceful nature of its nuclear programme, and to allow for negotiations. In his latest report on the Syrian Arab Republic, the Director General had urged that country to cooperate fully with the Agency. Denmark called on Syria to sign and ratify the additional protocol as soon as possible as a means of strengthening the confidence of the international community in the peaceful nature of its nuclear activities. 
79. A relatively new challenge was the threat posed by proliferation to non-State actors such as terrorists. The AgencyÂs work in the area of nuclear security was crucial and Denmark was committed to securing sufficient resources for the Nuclear Security Fund for that work. It welcomed the agreement reached to allocate increased Regular Budget resources to nuclear security. Denmark would also continue to give financial support to the Nuclear Security Fund on a voluntary basis and, in the coming years, would focus on activities in Asian countries. 
80. As Security Council resolution 1540 underlined, nuclear and other radioactive material must not fall into the hands of terrorists. To prevent that and proliferation in general, it was necessary to exercise strict export controls on a non-discriminatory basis. Denmark cooperated with partners in the European Union and the NSG. It also cooperated with Proliferation Security Initiative partners to prevent illegal transfers of weapons and material that might be misused for developing weapons of mass destruction and, with that aim in view, had hosted a Nordic-Baltic regional meeting in Copenhagen in September 2009. It encouraged all States to participate in such efforts to strengthen the non-proliferation regime. 
81. With regard to the peaceful uses of nuclear technology, Denmark had taken the stance that nuclear power was not a sustainable form of energy and should not be included in its own energy planning. While respecting the opinion and choice of others and noting the role of the Agency as stipulated in its Statute, his country was thus not in favour of a promotional role for the Agency in that field. Hence, Denmark had had some reservations regarding the various proposals for a multilateral nuclear fuel assurance mechanism. Nevertheless, the renewed interest in nuclear energy was a fact that had to be taken into account. His country considered it important to ensure that an expansion of civilian nuclear power did not result in a further spread of sensitive nuclear fuel cycle technologies that could be used for military purposes, so, together with its partners in the European Union, it was ready to support a multilateral proliferation-safe mechanism for assurance of supply of nuclear fuel for those States that had chosen the nuclear power option. Denmark welcomed the Director GeneralÂs proposal for the establishment of an IAEA LEU bank, and other proposals brought before the Board of 
Governors, and it looked forward to discussing those proposals with a view to finding responses to open questions and concerns. 
Mr Soltanieh (Islamic Republic of Iran) took the Chair. 

82. Mr AL-JASEM (Kuwait) said that since its establishment, the Agency had contributed to global peace, security and development and had made nuclear power one of the worldÂs main sources of energy. KuwaitÂs relationship with the Agency had entered a new stage in 2009. The Emir of Kuwait, Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah, had instructed the Government to elaborate an integrated national strategy for peaceful uses of nuclear energy. In March 2009, the Kuwaiti cabinet had decided, as a first step, to establish a high-level National Commission for Nuclear Energy chaired by the Prime Minister. It was planned to use nuclear energy, in cooperation with the Agency and under its supervision, for electricity generation and water desalination, and to build the national capacity and institutions required for such projects. 
83. The leaders of the Gulf Cooperation Council had decided in December 2006 to adopt a joint programme for peaceful uses of nuclear energy. Kuwait had actively participated in the consultations and meetings in that connection held between the Council and Agency experts. It welcomed the progress that had been made during the current year in elaborating a plan of action, as well as recommendations based on the AgencyÂs feasibility study. Kuwait, which would chair the Council in 2010, looked forward to even closer cooperation between the Agency and the Gulf Cooperation Council States. 
84. According to the AgencyÂs Annual Report for 2008, a total of 438 nuclear power reactors were currently in operation throughout the world, a figure that reflected the growing demand for nuclear technology and the increasingly important role of the Agency in terms of both nuclear expertise and its humanitarian mandate. 
85. His country had been keenly interested in the AgencyÂs technical cooperation programme for many years. It had implemented national projects and participated in regional projects in the areas of economic development, environmental protection and human health. Kuwait greatly appreciated the AgencyÂs assistance in that regard and trusted that it could continue to rely on its support in the future. It was important to identify stable sources of financing for the TCF in order to ensure the successful implementation of current and future projects, and to prevent any deficits from occurring. Although contributions to the TCF were voluntary, Kuwait consistently paid its share of the target. 
86. Kuwait accorded top priority to nuclear safety and security and strongly believed that all nuclear projects and programmes should comply with the AgencyÂs safety standards. Kuwait also welcomed the AgencyÂs continuous efforts to build up and enhance nuclear security capabilities. All Member States should support such action in order to ensure the requisite coordination of measures to strengthen security of nuclear and other radioactive material. Commending the assistance provided by the Agency in that regard, he said that Kuwait had joined the illicit trafficking database in May 2008. 
87. He expressed strong appreciation for the efforts of the Director General and the Secretariat to promote the effective implementation of the NPT and Agency safeguards agreements and additional protocols. In view of the importance of nuclear verification, he urged all Member States that had not yet signed a comprehensive safeguards agreement to do so, and he likewise encouraged States that had not signed an additional protocol to do so. 
88. He emphasized the importance of taking serious steps to rid the Middle East of all weapons of mass destruction, including nuclear weapons. It was imperative for Israel to accede to the NPT and to place its nuclear facilities under Agency safeguards. At the same time, his country reaffirmed the right of the States in the region to obtain and use nuclear technology for peaceful purposes. 
89. Kuwait called on Iran, the Agency and the group of States involved in dealing with the Iranian nuclear issue to continue engaging in a serious and constructive dialogue with a view to reaching a settlement that allayed all doubts and resolved outstanding issues. 
90. The world was currently facing new international challenges that were thwarting efforts to achieve sustainable development in many countries, chief among them the economic and financial crisis, the food crisis and climate change. Together with security challenges such as terrorism and the spread of weapons of mass destruction, those issues posed a serious threat to international peace and security. The Agency had an important role to play in addressing those challenges in cooperation with Member States, which should stand shoulder to shoulder in order to fulfil the aspirations of their peoples and create a world free from weapons of mass destruction. 
91. Mr SKOKNIC (Chile) said that promoting research into and the development and practical application of atomic energy through the Department of Technical Cooperation and specific projects with Member States was one of the AgencyÂs central functions. To help fulfil that function, his country had paid its full share of the TCF in 2009. Under the 2009Â2011 technical cooperation cycle, Chile was implementing 4 national projects and participating in 34 regional projects, 24 of which were ARCAL projects. 
92. With regard to nuclear power, since 2007 his country had been working with the Agency on various studies and reports and had organized workshops on public opinion and human resources. Although no political decision had been taken regarding nuclear power in Chile, the actions taken had allowed the issue to be tabled for discussion and not excluded a priori from the countryÂs future energy mix. Chile appreciated the support it had received from the Agency in performing studies to evaluate the possibility of embarking on a nuclear power programme. 
93. The Chilean Nuclear Energy Commission, together with the Agency, had held a regional training course on physical protection of nuclear material and facilities at the La Reina Nuclear Research Centre in November 2008. In the same month, Chile had also hosted a national seminar on radioactive waste management with the AgencyÂs cooperation. The first coordination meeting for an ARCAL project on nuclear applications in agriculture and environment had been held in Chile in April 2009. 
94. His country was party to various international instruments in the fields of nuclear and radiation safety, emergency assistance, civil liability for nuclear damage and the physical protection of nuclear material. It appreciated the AgencyÂs efforts to develop nuclear and radiation safety manuals, which had contributed to the creation of a safety culture. It also attached high priority to the safe transport of nuclear material and had insisted that the issue remain on the AgencyÂs agenda. It would continue actively to support initiatives Â including General Conference resolutions Â aimed at strengthening the transport safety regime. The dialogue that had been taking place within the framework of the Agency between representatives of coastal and shipping States was highly beneficial. 
95. Chile was in favour of the complete elimination of weapons of mass destruction, and of non-proliferation, and had signed and ratified the relevant international conventions, that being the best way to contribute to such an objective. The countries of Latin America and the Caribbean had demonstrated their common vision of nuclear energy for exclusively peaceful purposes through their adherence to the NPT and the Tlatelolco Treaty. Chile supported similar efforts in other regions of the world. In particular, it welcomed the entry into force of the Treaty on a Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone in Central Asia and the Pelindaba Treaty. The country was also working actively to arrange a second conference of States belonging to nuclear-weapon-free zones, to be held in the days leading up to the 2010 NPT Review Conference. 
96. It was important to give greater international support to the AgencyÂs safeguards regime through adherence to and ratification of comprehensive safeguards agreements and additional protocols. Ratification and implementation of the latter, though voluntary, was essential to consolidate the nuclear non-proliferation regime. ChileÂs additional protocol had entered into force in April 2004 and, since then, the country had submitted all the relevant declarations on time and had regularly carried out the necessary inspections. 
97. The AgencyÂs delicate safeguards role, entrusted to it by the international community through Article III of the NPT, had changed over time. The Agency was often referred to simply as a nuclear watchdog, with no regard for its other statutory functions or its promotion of nuclear applications to benefit human health and food security. The balance between the AgencyÂs statutory functions had shifted over the preceding decade, with most of the budget going to safeguards while technical cooperation, safety and security became increasingly dependent on voluntary and extrabudgetary contributions. That situation had to be monitored and dialogue maintained within the Agency to agree upon fair solutions that allowed the Agency to meet its responsibility to ensure the exclusively peaceful use of nuclear energy, and to strengthen its promotional activities to benefit developing countries. 
98. Chile had supported the AgencyÂs careful efforts to verify the non-diversion of nuclear material and technology to non-peaceful purposes in Iran. Acknowledging IranÂs collaboration thus far, he urged it to extend still further cooperation and comply with the relevant resolutions of the United Nations Security Council and AgencyÂs Board of Governors. Iran could only restore confidence in its nuclear programme by providing greater transparency and more information to the Agency, and by implementing the additional protocol. 
99. His country regretted the lack of progress towards denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and condemned the recent nuclear explosions carried out by the DPRK. It hoped that the diplomatic dialogue that was taking place among various States might lead to agreement on reintegration of the DPRK into the NPT and the effective dismantling of military nuclear facilities on the Peninsula. 
100. Expressing his countryÂs recognition for the Director GeneralÂs professional and important work over the preceding 12 years, he said that it had been characterized by vision, leadership, transparency, honesty, impartiality and commitment to multilateral diplomacy. Mr ElBaradei had made two visits to Chile, where he had held fruitful discussions with the national authorities and had been awarded an important national medal. He congratulated Mr Amano on his appointment as the new Director General and offered him his delegationÂs collaboration in successfully fulfilling his functions. In his new role he would face complex, varied and politically sensitive challenges related to both the administration of the Agency and its future functions and tasks, as well as the limited financial resources available. In discussions of such issues as safeguards and multilateral nuclear fuel supply initiatives in the Board it was clear that, in some areas, members differed enormously in their opinions. Patience would be required before common ground could be found with a view to meeting the growing demand for cooperation and technology transfer by members, and the constantly evolving non-proliferation challenges. Chile also valued the AgencyÂs considerable contribution to achieving the Millennium Development Goals. 
101. Mr BARRETT (Canada) said that the Agency remained an essential organization whose mandate was as relevant today as it had been when the Statute had entered into force in 1957. As a major donor, Canada supported the AgencyÂs continuing mission to implement and verify international safeguards, advance nuclear safety and security, and promote the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. 
102. The preceding decade had brought positive outcomes and new challenges for the Agency. As more countries turned to nuclear power to address the challenges of climate change and rising energy demand, it was essential that the Agency remain focused on its core mandates and not engage in tasks more appropriately addressed in other forums. Equally, more than ever, the Agency could not allow its work to be weakened by political differences. 
103. In his countryÂs view nuclear power had a vital role to play in the world for the foreseeable future and his country would remain a global leader in adapting nuclear power to the energy needs of the coming decades. His Government and Atomic Energy of Canada Limited were developing the advanced CANDU reactor which should have improved safety, economic and non-proliferation characteristics. The Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission had concluded that there were no fundamental barriers from a design viewpoint to licensing the reactor in Canada. 
104. Canada remained a strong supporter of the AgencyÂs technical cooperation activities and a major contributor to the TCF. It commended the SecretariatÂs efforts to improve prioritization and meet more efficiently and effectively the needs of donors and recipients. 
105. The development and implementation of the State-level approach to safeguards implementation and evaluation was a fundamental change in the AgencyÂs safeguards system, providing the basis for more efficient use of safeguards resources and for enhanced confidence in the SecretariatÂs assessment of a StateÂs compliance with its peaceful nuclear undertakings. In CanadaÂs case, the State-level approach was being applied in the context of integrated safeguards, based on the AgencyÂs conclusion that all nuclear material in the country remained in peaceful applications. The utilization of a StateÂ­level approach to safeguards implementation and evaluation had to be complemented by more focused and specific information relevant to activities in each State, providing greater transparency with respect to the use of the AgencyÂs verification resources. Canada continued to emphasize the importance of cooperation and transparency between Member States and the Secretariat in the implementation and evaluation of safeguards, and noted that the inspection effort to be applied in a given State should be based on the level of cooperation and transparency as well as on consistent compliance by the State concerned with its safeguards obligations. 
106. Canada welcomed IndiaÂs signing of the additional protocol approved by the Board of Governors in March 2009, and the ratification and entry into force of the India-specific safeguards agreement. Those texts formed the cornerstone of the agreement reached by India with the NSG in September 2008. 
107. IranÂs failure to provide critical information and full cooperation to the Agency belied its claims that its nuclear programme was peaceful in nature. Canada urged Iran to end its continued intransigence, to cooperate fully and transparently with the Agency, and to make a positive contribution to the global nuclear non-proliferation regime. 
108. The DPRKÂs unsafeguarded nuclear activities and aggressive weapons programme continued to pose a grave threat to international security and were particularly troubling for stability in north-east Asia. Canada called on the DPRK to seek a path that would lead to lasting peace on the Korean Peninsula and increased regional stability, and bring about major improvements in the lives of its people. It should return to the six-party talks and abide by its commitment to peaceful denuclearization through the resumption and completion of existing disablement activities. Canada also called on the DPRK to return to the NPT, implement its safeguards obligations and resume cooperation with the Agency. 
109. His country remained deeply concerned by revelations pointing to possible undeclared nuclear material, facilities and activities in the Syrian Arab Republic, and to possible nuclear cooperation 
between Syria and the DPRK. It encouraged Syria to cooperate fully and transparently with the Agency to restore confidence in the nature of its nuclear programme. 
110. Safety and security were of critical importance to the work of the Agency and to his country, and Canada actively participated in the development of Agency safety and security standards. As part of its commitment to continuous improvement, Canada had hosted an IRRS mission in June 2009 and it encouraged other Member States to avail themselves of that very useful service. The review team had found that Canada had a mature and well-established nuclear regulatory framework that ensured the safety and security of the Canadian nuclear industry, while also protecting the health of Canadians and the environment. The Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission was currently considering the review teamÂs recommendations with a view to their implementation. 
111. A coordinated effort was required to tackle the constant threat of nuclear terrorism and proliferation. Activities supported by the Nuclear Security Fund were essential to strengthen nuclear security worldwide, which was why Canada had contributed $13 million to the Fund as part of its continuing commitment to the G8 Global Partnership against the Spread of Weapons and Materials of Mass Destruction. CanadaÂs latest contribution of $4 million would support the activities described in the Nuclear Security Plan 2010 Â 2013, which his country supported. 
112. In closing, he said that Canada remained strongly committed to the goals of the Agency, and it welcomed the return to and greater emphasis on core nuclear energy issues in the AgencyÂs work. He trusted that the consensus regarding the balance between the AgencyÂs activities, which gave the Agency its strength of purpose, success and standing in the world, would continue to prevail. 
113. Ms MOSLEY (New Zealand) said that creating a world free of nuclear weapons was one of her countryÂs longstanding goals. It would not be simple to achieve, but New Zealand had been heartened by recent signs that the disarmament landscape was changing for the better and full advantage must be taken of that opportunity. 
114. New Zealand had participated actively in the constructive and positive third session of the Preparatory Committee for the 2010 NPT Review Conference in May 2009 and would continue to work towards a successful Conference, which would provide the opportunity to ensure that the Treaty remained relevant, effective and credible, and that it was implemented to the fullest extent. New Zealand endorsed the principle that nuclear technology should be available for peaceful uses in conformity with Article II of the Treaty, but with the expansion of the use of nuclear energy came a growth in the risks associated with it and, for that reason, her country would continue strongly to support the AgencyÂs work on safety and security and on verifying that nuclear material was not being diverted from peaceful uses. It attached importance to ensuring that the Agency had all the tools it needed to provide the international community with robust assurances that nuclear activities undertaken by States were purely for peaceful purposes. 
115. Current proliferation challenges meant that a comprehensive safeguards agreement alone was not adequate to provide the Agency with the necessary authority to carry out its verification mandate fully. The additional protocol was the contemporary verification standard and should always feature as a condition in new supply arrangements for nuclear and associated material. New Zealand strongly urged all State Parties that had not yet done so, particularly those with significant nuclear activities, to conclude and bring into force an additional protocol without delay. 
116. The possibility of terrorists obtaining nuclear or other radioactive material remained a grave threat and her country noted the concern that the uncertainty with regard to funding made the AgencyÂs programme planning and prioritization in the area of nuclear security difficult. New Zealand had supported the Nuclear Security Fund over the preceding year and its commitment to preventing 
nuclear material falling into the hands of terrorists was also demonstrated by its participation in the Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism and its chairmanship of the NSG in 2010. 
117. Nuclear safety was another important pillar of the AgencyÂs work and, in that connection, her country was committed to the principles and objectives of the Code of Conduct on the Safety and Security of Radioactive Sources and the Supplementary Guidance on the Import and Export of Radioactive Sources. The safe transport of radioactive material was of fundamental importance, and such shipments must be conducted in accordance with the highest possible safety and security standards, with appropriate information being provided to coastal States in advance of shipment and with proper emergency response systems in operation. An effective liability and compensation mechanism must be in place to insure against harm to human health and the environment, as well as possible economic loss, due to an accident or incident during the transport of radioactive material. New Zealand was pleased that progress was being made in many of those areas, notably in the reintegration of the transport resolution into the omnibus safety resolution, but it continued to urge all parties to strive for improvements. Her country welcomed the continued dialogue between coastal and shipping States on the related issues, in particular exchange of information regarding shipments. 
118. New Zealand condemned the nuclear test carried out earlier in 2009 by the DPRK which had dangerous implications for the security of the Korean Peninsula and the region, and was a significant step backwards for global disarmament and non-proliferation efforts. Her country had implemented the sanctions mandated by United Nations Security Council resolution 1874 (2009) and joined others in urging the DPRK to return to the six-party talks process, Agency safeguards and the NPT. 
119. Her country shared the concerns of the international community over the remaining questions regarding the Islamic Republic of IranÂs nuclear programme. She urged Iran to suspend its enrichment-and heavy water-related activities, implement the additional protocol and reconsider its decision to suspend implementation of the modified Code 3.1 of its Subsidiary Arrangements. New Zealand continued strongly to support a diplomatic solution based on IranÂs compliance with Agency and Security Council requirements, but Iran must play its part in realizing that outcome. 
120. In line with recent discussions in the Board of Governors, her country also called on the Syrian Arab Republic to be more cooperative and transparent in its provision to the Agency of information about and access to the Dair Alzour site and other related locations. 
121. The challenges facing the international non-proliferation regime were numerous and only likely to increase, so it was imperative that the international community work together to agree on and coordinate effective responses. The Agency had a vital role in that collective response, working with Member States to safeguard and secure nuclear material for exclusively peaceful purposes to the benefit of the global family. 
122. New Zealand supported the AgencyÂs work to apply the benefits of nuclear technology to human health, water quality, crop enhancement and pest control, as well as the SecretariatÂs efforts to develop national capacity in Member States and promote regional and international cooperation in those areas. Such issues needed urgent action on a global scale, and progress in them would make a real difference and, over time, benefit millions of people. 
123. Ms LACANLALE (Philippines) said that her country attached great importance to the application of nuclear technologies to meet contemporary challenges, particularly in the areas of food security, water resources management, environment and human health, with a view to achieving the Millennium Development Goals. In the area of food and agriculture, irradiation technology had been used in her country to support the national agenda on food security through mutation breeding, which had helped produce drought-resistant agricultural products. Through the joint FAO/IAEA programme 
on nuclear techniques in food and agriculture, the Philippines hoped to enhance the delivery of nuclear technologies for crop improvement, livestock production, and soil, water and fertilizer management. 
124. In the human health field, the Philippines welcomed the AgencyÂs valuable work under PACT and called on Member States and other funding institutions to donate generously to that programme. She trusted that the draft resolution on PACT that her country would be submitting to the Conference would meet with the approval of Member States. Noting that regional initiatives on cancer therapy could also be of benefit to PACT, she said that the Philippines had developed the best protocols for treating cancer patients through the Forum for Nuclear Cooperation in Asia. It also continued to conduct a two-year training programme for nuclear medicine technicians based on the RCA project on distance learning. 
125. The Philippines had achieved significant milestones in its environmental activities using radioisotopes and nuclear techniques. In December 2008, the Environmental Isotope Centre had been inaugurated, enabling the Philippines to conduct its own isotope analyses, and enhancing its capability to assess water resources. 
126. With the renewed interest in nuclear power as a reliable source of energy, more countries, particularly from the developing world, were turning to the Agency for assistance with the development or expansion of their nuclear power programmes. Confidence in the use of nuclear power hinged on the continuous improvement and strengthening of safety and security regimes, and the Philippines therefore attached great importance to the AgencyÂs programmes on safety and security. Her country was collaborating closely with the Agency on the development of a safety infrastructure and it appreciated the technical assistance it was receiving from the Agency in that regard, including with respect to the long-term management of radioactive waste and enhancing the competencies of technical personnel. Her country participated actively in various knowledge networks on safety, including the Asian Nuclear Safety Network, and it looked forward to contributing to the vision of a sustainable regional network by 2020. In the area of nuclear security, with the assistance of the Agency, it had refined its national nuclear security plan and developed an Integrated Nuclear Security Support Plan. 
127. A major challenge associated with the nuclear renaissance was the increasing risk of nuclear proliferation. The AgencyÂs safeguards activities played a critical role in ensuring the non-diversion of nuclear material, and it was important for the AgencyÂs nuclear verification capability to be strengthened. The conclusion of comprehensive safeguards agreements and additional protocols, as well as the provision of tools and resources to enable the Agency to implement a credible verification system, would go a long way towards reducing the risk of nuclear proliferation. That being said, it was necessary to resolve the issue of the balance between the AgencyÂs verification and promotional activities. Her country looked forward to the commencement of the negotiations of the working group on the budget, which it hoped would address some of the long-standing issues relating to the TCF. 
128. With regard to assurances of fuel supply, a multilateral framework, within which the Agency played a central role, would serve as an important tool for strengthening the non-proliferation regime. Consultations should continue to clarify issues raised by Member States with a view to promoting wider acceptance of the proposals put forward. The resulting mechanism should guarantee equal access to nuclear fuel and should not result in any Member State or group of States having a monopoly over nuclear fuel supply. 
129. Her country remained concerned over the lack of substantive progress in resolving the outstanding issues regarding the implementation of safeguards in Iran. She emphasized the importance of continued constructive dialogue among all parties concerned with a view to achieving a peaceful 
and comprehensive solution, and called on Iran to comply with relevant United Nations Security Council and Agency resolutions. 
130. With regard to the DPRKÂs nuclear programme, the Philippines noted with concern that countryÂs recent announcement concerning the current status of its enrichment activities following the total cessation of all cooperation with the Agency. The DPRKÂs intransigent acts constituted a serious threat to peace and stability in the region, and the Philippines urged the DPRK to return to the sixÂ­party talks and to the NPT, and to resume implementation of its safeguards agreement with the Agency. 
131. The Philippines strongly supported the establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones as a means of achieving nuclear non-proliferation. It urged all countries in the region to accede to the Bangkok Treaty and called for the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East. 
132. With regard to the nature of SyriaÂs nuclear programme, the Philippines encouraged Syria and all other parties concerned to extend full cooperation to the Agency so that the verification activities could be completed. 
133. The Philippines shared the vision of a world free of nuclear weapons and stressed the need for equal progress to be made in all three pillars of the NPT. It hoped that the 2010 NPT Review Conference would bring the world closer to achieving the objectives of the Treaty. 
134. Mr FERNÃNDEZ RONDÃN (Cuba) said that there was a growing need for nuclear applications in developing countries, hence the significance of the AgencyÂs activities. In Cuba, the application of nuclear technologies in vital areas of the economy was highly appreciated and his Government was committed to technical cooperation activities. Cuba had stepped up its participation in regional projects, especially under the ARCAL programme, in keeping with the priority which it gave to TCDC. 
135. As in the past, Cuba had met its financial commitments to the TCF on time and had paid its NPCs in full. In the preceding year, it had contributed half a million dollars to support one project on a cost-sharing basis. It had attained an implementation rate for national projects of 80%, which was higher than the average. 
136. Also, in 2008 Cuba had further increased its contributions to the technical cooperation programme, inter alia through the contribution of 29 experts for 53 international Agency missions and 8 teachers for training activities. Nine specialists from other countries had conducted training activities in Cuba. 
137. He underscored the importance of PACT and acknowledged the recent results achieved. In particular, his country valued highly the synergies that had been established within the framework of PACT with a number of international institutions and organizations and it welcomed the establishment of the WHO-IAEA Joint Programme on Cancer Control. He expressed appreciation to the Division for Latin America of the Department of Technical Cooperation for its efforts in 2008 to improve the various performance indicators and strengthen national capacities for managing the programme. He also stressed the need to maintain a suitable balance between human resources and equipment components in the design and implementation of technical cooperation projects, given the Agency's essential role in managing the procurement of materials and high-tech equipment, which developing countries sometimes found difficult to obtain. 
138. Referring to the damaging effect the unjust economic, commercial and financial blockade imposed on Cuba by the Government of the United States had on the Cuban people, he noted that difficulties in procuring scientific equipment for Cuban projects had grown, making project implementation more expensive, since equipment had to be purchased at more distant locations. That 
had an adverse impact on the achievement of objectives. Cuba denounced that policy, which was contrary to international law and the AgencyÂs Statute; at the same time, it acknowledged the ongoing efforts of the Secretariat to find alternatives and solutions, which had allowed Cuba to achieve high implementation rates. 
139. His country noted with satisfaction that activities related to nuclear and radiation safety had continued to develop satisfactorily in 2008. Thanks to the efforts of his Government and optimal use of Agency assistance with training and infrastructure, a national system had been set up which ensured comprehensive monitoring of staff exposed to ionizing radiation. Similar progress was taking place in other countries in the region with the help of Cuban experts. 
140. The Agency was in the process of analysing ways of making its work more effective in the future. In that connection, account must be taken of the great differences that existed between the nuclear programmes of Member States of the IAEA. A significant number of Member States had small quantities of nuclear material and many did not even have nuclear facilities, as that term was defined for safeguards purposes. Thus, general measures could not be devised for countries that had large or medium-sized nuclear programmes with the expectation that all countries comply. 
141. The verification process must be conducted fairly and impartially, as a prerequisite for preserving peace and security. It was not, and could not be, without limits or boundaries, as some sought to make it for the sake of purely geopolitical interests and in violation of the norms enshrined in international law and the Charter of the United Nations. It was important to prevent any attempt to exert pressure or indulge in undue interference that would undermine the efficiency and credibility of the AgencyÂs verification process. 
142. The political manipulations behind the so-called Iranian nuclear case, and the double standards that were being applied in the allegations against the Syrian Arab Republic and in the failure to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East, which the international community had been demanding for decades, should have ceased long ago. 
143. Cuba reaffirmed the need to respect the inalienable right of all States to use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. Under no circumstances should voluntary measures become obligations for Member States. The Agency was the sole competent authority for verifying the compliance of Member States with their obligations under safeguards agreements. Cuba trusted that the AgencyÂs work could continue without external interference, and it reiterated its appreciation for the professional and technical work of the Secretariat. 
144. Cuba underlined the importance of giving priority to peace and negotiation in resolving all international issues. If existing differences were to be addressed, dialogue must be based on equality and mutual respect. 
145. Cuba devoted considerable human and financial resources to meeting its obligations under its safeguards agreement. It carried out such actions as part of its political commitments under the NPT and the Tlatelolco Treaty, in the hope that those mechanisms would lead to the total elimination of nuclear weapons. 
146. It was vitally important to reaffirm the indissoluble link between non-proliferation and nuclear disarmament. 
147. Despite hopes for change, it was worrying that militarist policies continued to be applied and that so much was spent annually on weapons. It was in the hands of the international community to reverse that situation. The coming months would bring new opportunities and the 2010 NPT Review Conference would offer an opportunity to promote multilateral action and to enter into a real commitment to development, non-proliferation, nuclear disarmament and world peace. 
148. Mr GARCÃA REVILLA (Peru) said that his country shared the Director GeneralÂs vision of strengthening global cooperation in the peaceful uses of nuclear technology, promotion of nuclear safety and security worldwide, and the provision of assurances, through verification activities, of compliance with international obligations relating to the use of nuclear facilities and material for peaceful purposes. 
149. As a founding member of the Agency, Peru was committed to global peace and security, non-proliferation and disarmament. It would therefore be honoured to serve as a member of the Board of Governors for the period 2009Â2011 if elected during the Conference and undertook to contribute actively to achieving consensus. 
150. His country attached great importance to the non-proliferation regime and welcomed any decision aimed at strengthening it, particularly the universal adoption and implementation of the mechanisms established through such international instruments as the NPT and the Tlatelolco Treaty, which Peru had joined at an early stage. As a member of the worldÂs first nuclear-weapon-free zone, Peru strongly supported the establishment of such zones which helped strengthen the NPT regime. The creation of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East should be an abiding objective. It was also vital to redouble efforts to ensure the early entry into force of the CTBT. 
151. While his country recognized the right of all States to develop research, production and use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes, such activities must be conducted in strict compliance with nonÂ­proliferation obligations and Agency NPT safeguards regime, an important instrument of universal scope to which all States that had not yet done so should accede in order to guarantee a safer and more peaceful world. 
152. Peru regretted the fact that the DPRK had carried out a nuclear test in May 2009 and hoped for its speedy return to the NPT and the resumption of the six-party talks aimed at the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. 
153. To demonstrate transparency and its commitment to the AgencyÂs objectives relating to the nuclear verification and safeguards, Peru had signed an additional protocol to its safeguards agreement with the Agency in 1999. It complied with all the obligations it had assumed in that regard, as was regularly verified by the Agency. 
154. Peru had continued to participate during the preceding year in many activities aimed at enhancing the beneficial contributions of nuclear energy to the socio-economic development of Member States, promoting its safe use and building an increasingly effective regime to prevent diversion of nuclear energy for military or other unlawful purposes. 
155. The Peruvian Institute of Nuclear Energy, the body responsible for implementing national nuclear policy, had continued to implement its institutional strategic plan through programmes, projects and activities aimed at bringing added value to the production of goods and services in cases where nuclear technology offered comparative advantages. Major projects had been launched and were being implemented in cooperation with the Agency in such areas as modernizing and improving the use of the RP10 reactor, improving the treatment of cancer and cardiac diseases, training of human resources, and support for the improvement of nuclear technology in line with current advances in its rational and safer use. 
156. Over the preceding year, an occupational radiation protection programme had been launched with the assistance of Agency experts in the radioisotope production plant of the RACSO Nuclear Centre, the use of neutron activation analysis techniques had been optimized, and research activities aimed at improving alpaca wool fibre and reducing mortality rates among the camelid population on the Andean high plateau had been assessed jointly with the Cayetano Heredia Peruvian University. 
157. An evaluation mission had visited Peru from 29 June to 3 July to measure the impact of the use of irradiation technology on the countryÂs economic and social development, especially with regard to activities and products related to international trade. The visit had encouraged the Peruvian agroÂ­export sector to continue relying on irradiation of key fresh food export products such as asparagus. 
158. The knowledge and technology transferred to Peru through Agency experts enabled the country to train specialist technicians locally. Advanced courses were being organized in the use of nuclear technology in biotechnology, materials science, medicine, nuclear instrumentation and other areas. 
159. An IRRS mission to Peru had been undertaken from 19 to 30 April 2009, comprising experts from Spain, Turkey, the United Kingdom, Finland, France, Cuba, Argentina and Brazil, Agency inspectors and an observer from Vietnam. The objective of the mission had been to promote nuclear and radiation safety, and regulatory effectiveness, by comparing the existing regulatory structure with international standards. 
160. Finally, his country supported ARCAL, which had enhanced regional integration and forged cooperative links at regional level under the auspices of the ARCAL-IAEA Strategic Alliance. 
161. Ms TROJANOWSKA (Poland) reaffirmed her countryÂs full support for the Agency, which was the worldÂs focal point for peaceful nuclear cooperation and nuclear safety and security. Those two areas, together with verification, constituted the three pillars of the AgencyÂs Statute. 
162. The NPT had an exceptional position in the global non-proliferation regime and the Agency a unique mission in verifying nuclear non-proliferation worldwide. Her country hoped that, after the positive outcome of the third meeting of the Preparatory Committee, the 2010 NPT Review Conference would produce a consensus document. Poland viewed the universal adoption and implementation of comprehensive safeguards agreements and additional protocols as a prerequisite for a credible and effective safeguards system. Following its decision to join the European Union, her country had replaced its bilateral safeguards agreement and additional protocol with the trilateral safeguards agreement and additional protocol obligatory for European Union member States. It called upon other countries which had not yet done so to join the AgencyÂs comprehensive safeguards system as soon as possible. States with SQPs should also conclude an exchange of letters with the Agency to reinforce the safeguards system. 
163. Poland hoped that the sixth conference on facilitating the entry into force of the CTBT, which was to be held in New York following the General Conference, would make progress towards bringing that Treaty into force. Her country, which was one of the 44 States whose ratification was essential for the CTBT to enter into force, had completed the ratification process in 1999. 
164. The Agency played a pivotal role in global planning and coordination of efforts to protect the world against nuclear terrorism. One valuable instrument in that regard was the amended CPPNM, for which Poland had deposited its instruments of ratification in 2006. She expressed the hope that other States party to the Convention had done so, or would do so in the near future. Poland welcomed the newly adopted Nuclear Security Plan 2010Â2013 and supported the proposed increase in the Regular Budget for 2010 to fund core activities under the Plan, as the voluntary nature of contributions to the Nuclear Security Fund was a serious impediment to achieving the intended objectives. Poland had given both financial and in-kind support to nuclear security activities and encouraged other States to do likewise. 
165. Her country had been involved in the Global Threat Reduction Initiative since its inception and, under it, had converted its nuclear research reactor to LEU fuel. It had also transferred unirradiated HEU fuel to the Russian Federation, which had been completed in 2006. Currently, spent nuclear fuel of Russian origin was being repatriated to the Russian Federation. She thanked all parties involved in 
that complex process, in particular the United States Government, which had covered most of the costs. 
166. Her country was concerned to maintain the highest levels of nuclear safety worldwide. Although safety was a national responsibility, it could have implications beyond national boundaries and international cooperation was essential. The Agency, through its statutory programme, was a globally recognized forum for such cooperation and Poland, which was party to all international legal instruments developed in that field under the auspices of the Agency, was fully convinced of their importance and their essential role in keeping nuclear facilities and material safe and secure worldwide. Representatives of her country had participated in the third review meeting of the Contracting Parties to the Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management in May 2009, and it looked forward to the organizational meeting prior to the fifth review meeting of the Contracting Parties to the Convention on Nuclear Safety to be held soon. 
167. On 13 January 2009, the Government of Poland had adopted a resolution on activities to be undertaken to develop nuclear power in the country. The Polish nuclear power programme was to be elaborated by a Government Commissioner and submitted to the Council of Ministers, together with the proposed administrative and legal changes required for its implementation. On 12 May 2009, the Council of Ministers had established by ordinance the position of Government Commissioner for Nuclear Power and had defined the tasks and responsibilities of the position. 
168. Implementation of nuclear power in Poland was a priority in the countryÂs energy policy. The main objectives of the nuclear power programme were: to achieve optimum conditions for nuclear power development; to specify the necessary activities and tasks to be carried out by the State administration within a proposed time frame; to estimate the costs of nuclear power development and indicate funding sources; and to assess the economic, social and environmental impact of the programme. Preparation and implementation of the programme were being based on the AgencyÂs nuclear safety standards. Legislation and other activities under the programme would follow Agency principles and guidelines and draw on the experience of other Agency Member States. Consultation and cooperation with the Department of Technical Cooperation should optimize the process. PolandÂs new regulations relating to the programme would uphold the following basic principles: separation of regulatory functions and promotion and coordination functions; transparency of all activities; and preservation of safety culture at each stage. Other crucial elements of the programme included human resources development, public education and information and effective R&D support. Agency assistance was of essential importance for the programmeÂs success. She thanked the Director General for his prompt response to her countryÂs requests for INIR and IRRS missions. Poland looked forward to the establishment of a special technical cooperation programme which would provide assistance. 
169. Technical cooperation had always been and remained an important activity in relations between the Agency and Member States. In Europe, the technical cooperation programme had been greatly enhanced by regular consultation meetings aimed at developing new managerial tools to help make the programme more effective and efficient. Poland was a good example of a country that had moved from being just a recipient to being an important donor. Together with other new European Union members, it played an important double role, contributing to TCDC. Apart from national projects with a high rate of Government cost sharing, it actively participated in regional projects, offering its knowledge and competence to other Member States. 
170. Financing of technical cooperation activities should be assured, sufficient and predictable, and all Member States should demonstrate their commitment to the programme by pledging and paying in full and on time their shares of the TCF and their NPCs. Thus, her country strongly supported application of the due account principle. As in the past, it had pledged and paid its share of the TCF. 
171. In conclusion, she expressed support for the Director GeneralÂs efforts to initiate wide consultations on the future of the Agency and assured the organization of the continued support of her country. 
Mr Enkhsaikhan Jargalsaikhan (Mongolia) took the Chair. 

172. Mr STANKOVIC (Montenegro) said that, although his country was a new Agency member, it had come a long way since the first General Conference it had attended in 2007. Some developments in the preceding year had helped prepare for full implementation of international standards relating to radiation protection and safety, and of some operational activities. 

173. As an ecologically minded State, Montenegro recognized the importance of cooperation with the Agency with a view to environmental protection and enhancement of the quality of life of its citizens. The Agency had provided valuable technical and expert assistance in that regard, promoting the countryÂs development in line with sustainable development principles. 

174. Since achieving independence, the country had enacted a number of laws relating to radiation protection and had established an environmental protection agency which was responsible for regulatory control of radiation sources. He thanked the Agency for the assistance it had provided with those activities. 

175. During the 52nd regular session of the General Conference, Montenegro had signed a CPF, creating the basis for a planned approach in implementing technical assistance with the Agency. The CPF assigned priority to the following topics: environmental protection, illicit trafficking in nuclear and other radioactive material at border crossings, and oncology. 

176. The application of nuclear technology in medicine was a significant tool for enhancing human health. Currently, MontenegroÂs national technical cooperation programme focused on enhancement of the working conditions for the future oncology clinic, which should soon be completed. In addition to establishing the required technical infrastructure, significant resources were needed for staff training. Montenegro was also participating in over thirty regional projects. 

177. His country was committed to strengthening its national security system, and international mechanisms and cooperation to prevent illicit trafficking in nuclear and radioactive material. It took part in numerous non-proliferation initiatives, including the programme on the establishment of a knowledge management system on illicit trafficking in chemical, biological, radioactive and nuclear substances and weapons in south-east Europe and the Caucasus. It had signed a safeguards agreement and an additional protocol and would be ratifying them in the coming year. 

178. Finally, he reiterated the readiness of all the relevant authorities and institutions in his country to contribute actively to the AgencyÂs work. 

179. Ms TCHUENTE (Cameroon), said that as a supporter of international peace and security, her country was a party to the NPT, a comprehensive safeguards agreement and additional protocol, the Convention on Early Notification of a Nuclear Accident and the Convention on Assistance in the Case of a Nuclear Accident or Radiological Emergency. It had also ratified the Pelindaba Treaty and welcomed its entry into force. 

180. Only the AgencyÂs verification activities provided assurances that international obligations with regard to the use of nuclear material for peaceful purposes were being respected, and those activities must be facilitated by all Member States. 

181. Cameroon welcomed the SecretariatÂs efforts during 2008 to respond to the main sustainable development priorities through its technical cooperation programme. Increasingly, people were turning 
to nuclear technology in seeking solutions to the problems of food security, water resources management, and diagnosis and treatment of diseases such as cancer. Cameroon had benefited from national and regional technical cooperation projects in human health, agricultural productivity and food security, environmental protection, physical and chemical applications of radiation, water resources management, and nuclear safety and security. It expected such cooperation to increase in other priority areas for its national development, as envisaged in its CPF for 2009Â2013 to be signed during the current session of the General Conference. Cameroon had also hosted the 20th meeting of the technical working group for AFRA in YaoundÃ© in July 2009. 
182. Nuclear power was increasingly being seen as the inevitable solution to ensure energy security for the majority of developed and developing countries. Her countryÂs participation in the International Ministerial Conference on Nuclear Energy in the 21st Century, held in Beijing in April 2009, had demonstrated that its approach to the issue was based on dialogue and the sharing of experience. There had to be collaboration on such matters as mobilization of human resources, access to technologies, development of reactors of a size that met the needs of developing countries, the nuclear fuel cycle and radioactive waste management. There were concerns regarding the availability of qualified human resources for the introduction or expansion of nuclear power, security of nuclear fuel supplies, and equitable sharing of revenues from the exploitation of deposits of nuclear material between the countries in possession of the resources and those in possession of the technologies. 

183. It was important for the international community to provide the Agency with more resources to strike a global balance in the field of the peaceful use of nuclear science and technology. Cameroon had established a national radiation protection agency and intended to enhance its nuclear safety and security infrastructure with a view to introducing nuclear power in its energy mix. Technical assistance from the Agency would be a necessity to achieve its national objectives. 

184. There was a growing global need for nuclear technology, and the Agency was under pressure to meet Member StatesÂ requests and deal with new challenges. It was at the heart of coordinated efforts to confront the threats posed by nuclear terrorism, and was being called upon to assist States with the establishment of the infrastructures they needed to launch nuclear energy programmes, and to step up its safeguards activities. Cameroon was confident that the organization would rise to such challenges and would continue to support the progress of all Member States. 

185. Mr DÂUJANGA (Uganda) said his country appreciated the AgencyÂs ongoing support for peaceful applications of nuclear science and technology in the fields of health, water, agriculture and industry. 

186. In the field of human health, he commended Agency assistance and support for radiotherapy and nuclear medicine services. With the increase in the number of cancer cases, in particular cervical cancer, radiotherapy techniques had proved to be a crucial component in cancer management. His country particularly valued PACT and was grateful to the Agency for approving its request for an imPACT mission. It looked forward to working with the PACT team to develop a comprehensive national cancer control programme. 

187. As in many developing countries, access to clean drinking water was a serious problem in Uganda. He commended the Agency on its support for the use of isotope hydrology in assessing underground water resources with a view to developing comprehensive strategies and plans for water supplies for rural communities and small towns. His country looked forward to continued cooperation with the Agency in that field. 

188. The Joint FAO/IAEA Division of Nuclear Techniques in Food and Agriculture had done and was doing an excellent job in conducting research to develop disease-and drought-resistant varieties of crops and improve animal production. Erratic rainfall and drought had brought biting hunger to 
many people in Uganda and neighbouring countries. Many had died of starvation. He appealed to the Agency to strengthen the activities of the Joint Division. 
189. Access to modern energy services, in particular electricity, remained a major challenge for his country and other developing countries, especially in sub-Saharan Africa. There was enormous potential for power generation from renewable energy sources such as hydroelectric power, solar power, geothermal power, biomass and wind, as well as from fossil fuels. Energy supply and demand studies showed that, in the long run, those resources would not be sufficient to meet demand. Thus, there was a need to diversify the energy mix and include nuclear power. Furthermore, the growing concern over global warming and climate change made it incumbent on every nation to choose an energy supply that helped mitigate climate change. 
190. For the aforegoing reasons, his country had taken the courageous step of starting to build capacity for the introduction of nuclear power. The Atomic Energy Act 2008 provided for the development of a peaceful nuclear power programme within the boundaries of the AgencyÂs safeguards and safety regimes. He commended the Agency for the support it was giving to countries interested in launching nuclear power programmes. The AgencyÂs milestone approach and the INPRO methodology were helpful tools for newcomer countries. His country was particularly appreciative of the AgencyÂs work on the development and deployment of safe, secure, economically viable and proliferation-resistant small and medium-sized reactors, which would be ideal for developing countries. 
191. He congratulated the Government and people of Sweden on reversing their decision regarding nuclear power. Equally, he expressed appreciation for the Global Nuclear Energy Partnership which aimed to facilitate the safe and secure expansion of nuclear power while minimizing proliferation risks. 
192. Safeguards and verification remained the key instrument in enhancing the peaceful use of nuclear power technology. Uganda greatly appreciated the courageous steps taken by the Presidents of the United States of America and the Russian Federation regarding the reduction of their nuclear arsenals. However, much more needed to be done in that respect to build trust. He stressed that safeguards measures should continue to be applied comprehensively and impartially. 
193. As peaceful applications of radioactive material expanded throughout the world, the challenges of ensuring safety and security increased. The main concern for developing countries was illicit trafficking in nuclear and radioactive material. In most cases, the cause of illicit trafficking was a desire to get rich quick. Many people in developing countries thought that every type of radioactive material was uranium for which a lot of money could be got on the black market. Trafficking in such material put the lives of many people at risk, both the traffickers and the public. He expressed appreciation in that regard for the work of the AgencyÂs Department of Nuclear Safety and Security and the Global Threat Reduction Initiative. 
194. In conclusion, he re-emphasized the importance of the contribution of atomic energy to health and prosperity throughout the world, expressing appreciation for the AgencyÂs efforts in that regard, particularly under the technical cooperation programme. Uganda would continue to support the Agency and believed that, with the joint efforts of Member States and the Secretariat, the organization would be able to fulfil its mission. 
195. Mr TURDIU (Albania) said that his country had completed its two-year term on the Board of Governors, during which time it had taken an active part in all discussions and had provided its own modest contribution to important issues. The Albanian Government lent its full support to the AgencyÂs activities and would continue to do so in the future. 
196. Albania would continue to contribute to efforts relating to the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and to meet all its obligations in the Agency. It thus attached particular importance to the implementation of all resolutions adopted by the AgencyÂs General Conference and decisions of the Board of Governors, especially those that aimed at ensuring an effective and efficient international safeguards system and those that were universal in nature. Conscious as it was of the importance of the additional protocol as an instrument to achieve those objectives, his country had signed one and was in the process of ratifying it. It was also taking the final legislative measures to complete and adopt a comprehensive national atomic law which would also cover safeguards-related issues, as well as the relevant structures to ensure executive leadership and control over all nuclear-and radiation-related obligations, requirements and standards. 
197. Nuclear applications were a priority for the Albanian Government, as were nuclear safety and security, and the country was working to improve and consolidate its regulatory framework, to adapt and harmonize the relevant national infrastructure and to consolidate the legal basis for all nuclearÂ­related activities. 
198. Albania would continue to be a beneficiary of PACT, highly appreciated the AgencyÂs contribution and assistance in that area and was committed to strengthening cancer control activities in the country. 
199. Both power and non-power applications of nuclear technology had a clear future in Albania. However, nuclear technology transfer and implementation was a long process and the AgencyÂs cooperation and assistance would be required for many years to come. The Albanian Government was looking seriously into the possibility of using nuclear technology for power generation and had taken initial steps in that regard, with Agency cooperation. 
200. The Albanian Government also attached great importance to continued cooperation in the field of nuclear security. It was committed and assigned top priority to ensuring effective prevention and combating of illicit trafficking in radioactive material, and of organized crime and terrorism. Border management and control had been greatly strengthened. The Agency had been providing advisory services to help establish the necessary infrastructure and Albania was part of the AgencyÂs global plan to combat nuclear terrorism. 
201. Mr AMADOU TIDIANE (Senegal) paid tribute to the Director General for his commitment, far-sightedness and determination in the service of peace, safety and security, and in strengthening the AgencyÂs activities on peaceful uses of nuclear science and technology for sustainable economic and social development, culminating in the award of the Nobel Peace Prize. He also welcomed his successor, Mr Amano. 
202. Senegal was determined to continue developing the wide-ranging cooperation it already enjoyed with the Agency in such areas as training, technology transfer, provision of state-of-the-art medical equipment, exchanges of experts and scientific meetings, and research support in water resources management, improvement of agricultural production, stockbreeding development, radiation protection and malnutrition. That was why Senegal had met all its financial obligations vis-Ã -vis the Agency. Since joining the Agency, it had also ratified various legal instruments, inter alia the Pelindaba Treaty. 
203. The global energy crisis was felt particularly acutely by poor countries like his own, for which energy security had become a major preoccupation and nuclear energy a resource that had to be taken into account. SenegalÂs current energy policy was primarily based on fossil fuels, with solar and biofuel options, but its plans included the possibility of using nuclear energy for electricity generation. It had ratified the Vienna Convention on Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage, the Convention on Assistance in the Case of Nuclear Accident or Radiological Emergency, the Convention on Nuclear 
Safety, the Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management, and the Convention on Early Notification of a Nuclear Accident. It had also recently adopted a law on nuclear safety and radiation protection and planned in the near future to establish an independent regulatory body. His country was also participating in AFRA project RAF/9/038 with a view to establishing a national regulatory infrastructure in line with international standards, and an African regulators network. 
204. Senegal reaffirmed its total support for the AgencyÂs ideals of peace and development and would spare no effort in its active promotion of the use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes and in strengthening the nuclear non-proliferation regime. Thanking the Agency for the technical cooperation it provided to his country, he sought its continued support in any forthcoming development of nuclear energy for peace and sustainable development on a local or global scale. 
205. Mr RISTORI (European Commission) expressed appreciation for the Director GeneralÂs efforts to reinforce cooperation between the Agency and the European Commission. 
206. The role of nuclear energy in reducing CO2 emissions was now largely recognized. Nuclear energy provided almost one third of the electricity consumed and two thirds of the CO2-free electricity in the European Union. It could also play a decisive role in securing energy supply. Within the European Union and globally, the trend was in the direction of more nuclear energy with a broader range of applications. However, there was a need to limit the related risks while respecting the right of every country to use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. The European Union was playing an increasing role in that regard, particularly in the field of nuclear safety, with the AgencyÂs cooperation. 
207. Nuclear safety remained a priority and, in June 2009, the European Council had adopted the revised Commission proposal for a directive establishing a Community framework for the nuclear safety of nuclear installations, which had been supported by all 27 Member States, the European Parliament and the European Economic and Social Committee. The European Union had become the first major regional nuclear actor to give binding legal force to the AgencyÂs Safety Fundamentals and the obligations resulting from the Convention on Nuclear Safety. It had cooperated fruitfully with the Agency in the preparation of the nuclear safety directive and hoped to strengthen that cooperation further to develop an even more advanced framework for nuclear energy meeting the highest standards of safety, security and non-proliferation. The directive had also taken into account the contributions from the European Nuclear Safety Regulators Group whose first activity report, presented in July 2009, contained detailed recommendations for improving nuclear safety, spent fuel and radioactive waste management and decommissioning. 
208. Cooperation with third countries was being implemented under the Nuclear Safety Cooperation Instrument and the Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance. The European Union also cooperated with the Agency to implement specific projects with IAEA Member States, and consultations were under way with countries that had declared their intention to embark upon or expand their civil nuclear power programmes. 
209. Following the adoption of the nuclear safety directive, the Commission was also considering progress in the field of the safe management of nuclear waste. 
210. It was actively developing a common understanding for the management of decommissioning funds. A financial assistance programme for decommissioning of the Bohunice, Ignalina and Kozloduy nuclear power plants was also ongoing in cooperation with the EBRD. 
211. Both the Agency and the European Commission were incorporating the new recommendations issued by the International Commission on Radiological Protection into their respective basic safety 
standards. For Euratom, that presented an opportunity for a major recast of all related legislation into a single act. 
212. The European Union supported the AgencyÂs nuclear security activities through its strategy against proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. It was also one of the main contributors to the Nuclear Security Fund through joint actions adopted by the European Council and contributions by individual Member States. 
213. Cooperation on nuclear safeguards between Euratom and the Agency was well on track. The Commission had made a particular effort to strengthen cooperation in implementing safeguards agreements between Euratom, the Agency and European Union member States. The integrated safeguards partnership approach was in the process of being introduced and, by the end of 2009, the nuclear facilities of all European Union non-nuclear-weapon States were expected to be covered by integrated safeguards. The European CommissionÂs safeguards support programme was becoming one of the largest in the field. 
214. The great challenge ahead as regards nuclear non-proliferation was the review of the NPT at the 2010 NPT Review Conference. A new framework for civil nuclear cooperation needed to be built, and the European Commission and European Council were ready to provide financing and technical expertise to that end. 
215. The CommissionÂs Strategic Energy Technology Plan was an important link between energy policy and the technological development needed to meet the European UnionÂs energy and climate change policy objectives. Euratom had supported research in nuclear fission and fusion for many years. The projects under the Seventh Framework Programme covered a broad range of areas including nuclear safety, radiation protection, geological waste disposal, Generation IV reactor designs, research infrastructures, education and training. Those projects were open to international cooperation. 
216. As regards nuclear liability, many different regimes coexisted within the European Union, particularly following its expansion. The Commission was assessing the situation and the possible need for improvement. 
217. The European Nuclear Energy Forum pursued broad and constructive discussion with relevant stakeholders from all member States on opportunities, risks and transparency with respect to nuclear energy. The most recent meeting had been held in Prague in May 2009, and the subsequent one would be held in Bratislava in 2010. 
218. It was essential to enhance international cooperation, given the current global context and the fact that two major international events Â the summit on global nuclear security announced by the President of the United States, and the NPT Review Conference Â would be taking place in the coming year. The European Union could contribute to non-proliferation at global level based on its extensive experience in the nuclear fuel cycle and the range of legal instruments at its disposal. 
219. Finally, the European Commission welcomed the ongoing debate on the future of the Agency. It supported the strengthening of the Agency, which represented the interests of nations using, or intending to use, nuclear energy for peaceful purposes.

8. 	General debate and Annual Report for 2008 (continued) (GC(53)/7) 

1. Ms DRÃBOVÃ (Czech Republic) commended the outgoing Director General, Mr ElBaradei, on his accomplishments over the previous twelve years, and congratulated his successor, Mr Amano, on his appointment. 

2. The Czech Republic continued to attach great importance to the strengthening of the nonÂ­proliferation regime and to enhancing nuclear security worldwide. The universal adoption and implementation of comprehensive safeguards agreements and additional protocols Â the current verification standard Â remained essential. Her country attached high priority to updates of Annex II to the additional protocol to reflect the technical progress made in nuclear civil trade, and stressed the importance of the Zangger Committee in updating the clarification of requirements of Article III.2 of the NPT. 

3. In accordance with EU accession conditions, the Czech Republic had completed its internal procedures regarding the entry into force of the trilateral safeguards agreement and its additional protocol. Her country recognized the need for the Agency to maintain and further strengthen its capability to provide credible and timely analysis of safeguards samples. It had already offered the Agency its capacities in that regard and would also be making a voluntary contribution to support the upgrading of the nuclear material laboratory as part of the modernization of the Safeguards Analytical Laboratory. 

4. The Czech Republic had been sharing with other countries the valuable experience it had gained from the successful completion in 2007 of the repatriation of spent HEU within the framework of the Global Threat Reduction Initiative. It also continued to support the safe repatriation of spent nuclear fuel from the Vin?a RA Research Reactor in Serbia to the Russian Federation, and had pledged to make available the last portion of its US $ 1 million contribution by April 2010. 

5. Nuclear power provided some 40% of the electricity generated in the Czech Republic, and the operators and agencies involved had always strived to ensure the highest achievable level of nuclear safety. The sharing of experience and best practice through the Agency was crucial in achieving the requisite safety levels, and she commended the Agency for its efforts to cooperate with other relevant organizations in formulating or improving the safety standards. The Czech Republic particularly appreciated the broad collaboration between EU Member States, relevant EU institutions and the Agency in nuclear safety matters. The AgencyÂs safety principles and recommendations, together with the Convention on Nuclear Safety, had constituted the basis for a new legally binding EU Directive establishing a Community framework for the nuclear safety of nuclear installations recently adopted under the Czech presidency of the EU. 

6. The technical cooperation programme was an essential tool for the further development of participating Member States. A number of Member States were developing more of a partnership with the Agency with respect to the technical cooperation programme, and the different development needs of individual regions were being recognized. Her country, for example, was actively participating in the development of the technical cooperation strategy for the Europe region, which sought to outline a basic vision of the technical cooperation programme in the region as well as the means of achieving the main strategic objectives. The Czech Republic had always fully supported the technical cooperation programme; it continued to pay its contributions to the TCF and its NPCs in full and on 
time, and co-financed its single national project. Furthermore, over the previous 12 years, it had provided voluntary contributions of almost US $ 4 million to support activities in other Member States through the technical cooperation programme, as well as other programmes, including the NSF and PACT. 
7. Mr BÃCK (Austria) congratulated Mr Amano on his appointment and commended Mr ElBaradei for his work over the past 12 years as Director General. During his outstanding service, the Agency had made a major contribution to peace, security and safety as well as to the promotion of health and prosperity. The Director General had repeatedly reminded the international community of the need to address the root causes of major crises and to focus on the wellbeing of the human family. Austria fully supported the resolution conferring on Dr ElBaradei the title of Director General Emeritus of the International Atomic Energy Agency. 

8. Nuclear disarmament and the elimination of nuclear weapons should be in the common interest of all members of the international community. As a non-nuclear country, Austria greatly valued and supported the Agency's vital role with regard to the NPT regime. It would continue to support all efforts aimed at strengthening and universalizing the safeguards system, including the additional protocol, and at making the Agency fit to tackle the growing challenges in the area of nuclear nonÂ­proliferation and safety. 

9. The many challenges to the NPT that persisted should not be underestimated. Austria reiterated the appeals by the Swedish Presidency of the European Union regarding the resumption of Agency work in the DPRK, the clarification of questions related to the nuclear activities of the Islamic Republic of Iran and the provision of relevant information by the Syrian Arab Republic. 

10. Significant progress needed to be made at the 2010 NPT Review Conference in New York. Although the third session of the Preparatory Committee in May 2009 had raised hopes for a productive Review Conference in 2010, it had also demonstrated how much work still needed to be done politically and diplomatically to achieve the kind of agreements and commitments that would genuinely strengthen the non-proliferation regime and provide a basis for building security in a world free of nuclear weapons. Austria would play an active role in the Review Conference. It would support initiatives aimed at making substantial progress in nuclear disarmament, at institutionally strengthening nuclear non-proliferation, promoting NWFZs and establishing a fair global system that effectively controlled the nuclear fuel cycle. All those efforts should ultimately reduce the current international mistrust over national nuclear programmes. 

11. In recent years, Austria had participated actively in the debate on multilateral approaches to the nuclear fuel cycle, presenting a working paper entitled "multilateralization of the nuclear fuel cycle: increasing transparency and sustainable security" during the debate on the issue in the Board of Governors in June. The proposal for the establishment of a LEU bank under Agency control was an ambitious project and a good first step forward in a process eventually leading to the full multilateralization of the nuclear fuel cycle. The framework proposed by Austria would ultimately result in a more comprehensive implementation of Article IV of the NPT, in which the benefits of all stages of the nuclear fuel cycle would be available on a fair and equal basis to all States that sought them. 

12. Safety and security awareness were essential for the construction of nuclear power plants. Therefore, delays in the completion of nuclear power plants should be acceptable if more time was required to make the plants safer and more secure. Austria welcomed the AgencyÂs support in assisting regulatory authorities in Member States in the design and construction phase, thus upgrading the overall safety of new reactors. Compliance by all Member States with the provisions and obligations of the relevant safety conventions constituted an important goal. The global nuclear community must 
also focus on the challenges that national regulatory authorities were currently facing to ensure that safety and security kept pace with emerging technologies. The development of technical systems should however be a matter for the industrial sector, which had gained more than 50 years of experience. 
13. Higher prices for nuclear power could be seen as a sign of that some of the external costs of nuclear energy were being absorbed. Austria favoured the full internalization of all costs related to nuclear power, including the disposal of spent nuclear fuel, decommissioning and, most importantly, unlimited nuclear liability. 
14. With regard to emergency preparedness and response, he said that the position of non-nuclear countries bordering nuclear countries should be fully recognized. However, that was scarcely reflected in the Agency's documents on nuclear power programmes. In AustriaÂs view, the responsibility for emergency response should not end at national borders, but should be a common effort at transboundary level. 
15. The Third Review Meeting of the Joint Convention, held in Vienna in 2009, had shown that a large number of facilities worldwide undertaking decommissioning activities continued to be underfunded. Such a situation, together with the problem of securing the safe final long-term disposal of spent nuclear fuel called into question the sustainability of the nuclear power sector. 
16. The AgencyÂs safeguards system was an indispensable part of the international nuclear nonÂ­proliferation regime. The level of assurance obtained, however, depended on the scope of authority States were prepared to assign to the Agency. Repeated cases of clandestine nuclear programmes that could not be detected by traditional safeguards measures had demonstrated the need for a stronger safeguards system. It was of the utmost importance for the Agency to be able to draw safeguards conclusions regarding the peaceful use of all nuclear material wherever it was located. The majority of NPT non-nuclear-weapon States with comprehensive safeguards agreements had brought an additional protocol into force. That provided the Agency with a sound basis for the implementation of integrated safeguards and for further refining the integrated safeguards system. However, progress remained slow: a number of important goals relating to the implementation of the additional protocol could only be realized once universality had been achieved. Austria strongly advocated adherence to the additional protocol and considered the conclusion of an additional protocol by non-nuclear-weapon States parties to the NPT a legal obligation. 
17. It was important for the Agency to be able to maintain both the quantity and quality of its analytical services if it was to sustain an efficient and effective safeguards system, and he highlighted the importance of the work undertaken at the Safeguards Analytical Laboratory in Seibersdorf. Austria was pleased that the voluntary contributions already pledged for the project on enhancing the capabilities of analytical safeguards would facilitate the process of redeveloping the Seibersdorf site in the near future. Austria was demonstrating its commitment to that undertaking by providing more than 60,000 square meters of land. 
18. With its special focus on monitoring, verification and assistance, the Agency helped to strengthen Vienna as a centre of competence for the interrelated issues of security and development. Over the previous 50 years, the Agency had contributed to a whole range of development projects through its technical cooperation programme. Austria recognized the vital importance of those activities and would continue to support the TCF in 2010. 
19. There was much evidence that nuclear non-proliferation and nuclear safety and security would continue to demand a high and increasing level of international cooperation in the years to come. It was crucial for the Agency to be fully equipped and funded to fulfil its important tasks in that regard. 
20. Mr FAHMI (Iraq) congratulated Mr Amano on his election to the office of Director General, and thanked the outgoing Director General, Mr ElBaradei, for his outstanding service to the Agency throughout his tenure. 
21. The Government of Iraq greatly appreciated the AgencyÂs assistance to all Member States, especially developing countries, in areas such as human health, the environment, industry, agriculture and water resources, and its support for the safe use of nuclear energy and for scientific and technological development. 
22. In April 2009, his Government had decided to establish a National Atomic Energy Agency composed of representatives of relevant Iraqi ministries and institutions. The Agency's mandate consisted in proposing national policies for peaceful applications of nuclear energy and a national programme for the development of qualified human resources to work in national institutions that used nuclear technology. It would also offer scientific advice to the countryÂs decision-making bodies. 
23. The department that dealt with radioactive waste processing and management at the Ministry of Science and Technology had been modernized to assume responsibility for addressing the problem of radioactive waste present in numerous parts of Iraq and for dealing with the waste that would be generated by the cleaning-up of destroyed installations and sites operated under the previous nuclear programme or by the elimination of radioactive pollution in southern regions of the country. The Iraqi Government strongly commended the AgencyÂs work under the technical cooperation programme in support of Member States, especially its role in cleaning up contaminated nuclear sites. However, it would appreciate greater and more extensive Agency cooperation in eradicating radioactive waste. It needed stronger support in ridding the Iraqi environment of all types of radioactive contamination and in using nuclear technology to trace an estimated 25 million landmines that were scattered throughout the country. Their existence was a major impediment to agricultural development in a large part of the country and claimed a large number of human victims each year. 
24. The Iraqi Government also commended the AgencyÂs humanitarian role, as reflected, for example, through PACT. His country would appreciate greater assistance in the early detection and treatment of cancerous tumours in order to reduce the mortality rate, especially among children, which had risen in recent years for a number of reasons, particularly the pollution of the Iraqi environment and the limited means available to specialized medical centres. He expressed gratitude to all countries that had expressed their willingness to assist Iraq under the PACT Programme. 
25. Water scarcity was another major problem in Iraq, as was water pollution, which had increased to dangerous levels in recent years. The Government hoped that the Agency would step up its activities in that area, which would be given high priority in the future development plans of developing countries. 
26. His Government supported the AgencyÂs efforts to ensure that nuclear energy was used only for peaceful purposes and to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons, especially in the Middle East. It reaffirmed the importance of comprehensive safeguards regime, which should be applied to all States without exception. It was imperative for Israel to accede to the NPT and to place all its nuclear installations under full-scope Agency safeguards as a basic step towards confidence-building among the countries of the region and the achievement of a just, comprehensive and lasting peace. 
27. His Government also supported all international activities, both legislative and technical, aimed at combating nuclear terrorism, especially action to control and prevent the proliferation of radioactive sources, illicit trafficking in nuclear material and radioactive sources, increased surveillance of border crossings and strengthening of nuclear material accounting systems. 
28. The Iraqi Government had taken steps to sign an additional protocol and the CTBT, and both instruments were currently before the Iraqi Parliament for ratification. Specialized committees were studying the question of accession to the CPPNM, the Joint Convention, the Convention on Nuclear Safety and the International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism. They were also studying the Code of Conduct on the Safety and Security of Radioactive Sources. It was hoped that the entire process would be completed by early 2010. During 2009, the Government had enacted a law concerning the Iraqi National Non-Proliferation Regulatory Authority, an independent authority to ensure compliance with IraqÂs obligations under non-proliferation instruments. 
29. Mr HERNÃNDEZ GARCÃA (Spain) said that his Government attached priority to the efforts to strengthen the non-proliferation regime, and drew attention in that regard to the Spanish safeguards support programme, which was financed through extrabudgetary contributions. 
30. Spain welcomed the impartiality, independence and professionalism shown by the Director General and the Agency in their attempts to clarify the nature of IranÂs nuclear programme. It also appreciated their repeated calls for a negotiated solution, rather than confrontation. Spain joined others in urging the Iranian authorities to comply with United Nations Security Council resolutions, demonstrate greater transparency, cooperate with the Agency and implement the additional protocol, in order to restore international confidence in the peaceful nature of the Iranian nuclear programme. 
31. The authorities of the DPRK had recently embarked upon a dangerous course. His Government supported the international calls urging the DPRK to return to the six-party talks, comply with United Nations Security Council resolutions, return to the NPT, and revoke its decisions to expel Agency inspectors and to rehabilitate previously dismantled nuclear installations. 
32. Spain also called upon the Syrian Arab Republic to cooperate fully with the Agency in order to restore international confidence in the exclusively peaceful nature of its nuclear programme. 
33. Given that the most effective response to the threat of nuclear proliferation was the swift and universal implementation of additional protocols, his delegation remained concerned that 12 years after the adoption of the Model Additional Protocol, that instrument had not yet entered into force in 104 States, and that 26 States parties to the NPT had not even concluded a comprehensive safeguards agreement. The Agency must continue its efforts to promote the rapid and universal application of those instruments. That being said, his country was pleased to note that integrated safeguards were already being implemented in 26 countries. The application of integrated safeguards to all States with safeguards agreements and additional protocols in force would streamline the system and save human and financial resources, which was particularly important in times of budgetary restraint. Spain was committed to working with the Agency and the European Commission with a view to introducing integrated safeguards in the Member States of the European Union before the end of 2009. 
34. His Government welcomed the activities of the Department of Nuclear Safety and Security aimed at improving the physical protection of nuclear materials, installations and high-activity radioactive sources. It fully supported the Nuclear Security Plan for 2010Â2013, and made a significant contribution to the NSF. His country attached particular importance to the proper functioning of an integrated national system that ensured the security of the nuclear industry and related activities and helped prevent the illicit trafficking and use of nuclear and radioactive materials. Spain would continue cooperating with other Member States in the fight against nuclear terrorism and illicit use of radioactive materials, as it had done since joining the Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism. It called upon the Agency to publish comprehensive nuclear security guidelines and to continue to promote the ratification of the amendment to the CPPNM. 
35. With regard to nuclear safety and radiation protection, he said that the Ibero-American Forum of Radiological and Nuclear Regulatory Agencies was an excellent example of sustainable regional 
cooperation, which was self-financed but benefited from the AgencyÂs indispensable support. It could provide an excellent model to promote cooperation between neighbouring countries in close cooperation with the Agency. 
36. An international conference on control and management of inadvertent radioactive material in scrap metal had been held in Tarragona from 23 to 27 February 2009 with the participation of over 250 experts from 63 countries. Given the global nature of issues linked to the management and control of orphan sources, it could be useful to develop an international legal instrument or agreement to standardize criteria and procedures. Following the Conference, a workshop had been held in Tarragona in which a proposal made by the Nuclear Regulatory Authority of Argentina concerning a strategy for the prevention, detection and response to orphan sources in scrap metal had been discussed. 
37. Spain, in cooperation with the Agency and the Nuclear Safety Council, had also held an international workshop on lessons learned from the Integrated Regulatory Review Service in Seville from 3 to 4 November 2008. The programme established by the Agency for such missions was reviewed and possible improvements discussed. His Government considered IRRS missions to be of great benefit, and would continue to support their implementation. 
38. Spain would, together with France and Italy, continue to act as regional coordinator for the activities conducted in the Mediterranean region in connection with the action plan developed concerning problems associated with delays and denials of shipment of radioactive materials. 
39. Spain had participated actively in the revision of the AgencyÂs International Nuclear Event Scale UserÂs Manual, and was taking the necessary steps in order to use the Nuclear Event Scale domestically as a means of communicating information to the general public. 
40. Spain attached importance to the AgencyÂs technical cooperation activities, and continued to pay its full share of the target. It also financed projects to assist countries in Latin American and North Africa in improving their regulatory infrastructures through the Nuclear Safety Council and the Research Centre for Energy, Environment and Technology. His country also provided experts, and offered training courses, fellowships, and scientific visits, and would continue participating in the AgencyÂs efforts to improve the seismic safety of existing nuclear installations. 
41. The ARCAL Agreement would be celebrating its twenty-fifth anniversary in 2009. The Research Centre for Energy, Environment and Technology cooperated closely with ARCAL and would be actively involved in the modification of the Regional Strategic Profile. His country encouraged the Agency to maintain its active cooperation with ARCAL. 
42. Turning to the nuclear sector in Spain, he said that there were eight units in operation at six sites with an installed capacity of 7 728 MW. In 2008, 18.4 % of the countryÂs electricity had been generated using nuclear power, illustrating the important role of nuclear energy in SpainÂs energy mix. 
43. The process to select a location in Spain for a centralized temporary storage facility for spent fuel and high-level waste was still ongoing. A public hearing would be conducted in the autumn during which municipalities could express interest in hosting the facility. In October 2008, a facility for very low level waste at El Cabril had become operational. The facility would facilitate the management of large volumes of such waste, generated mainly during the dismantlement of nuclear power plants. 
44. In closing, he thanked the outgoing Director General for his independent, impartial and tireless efforts over the previous 12 years to ensure the AgencyÂs effective contribution to peace, security and the welfare of humankind. He also congratulated the Director General designate on his election and assured him of SpainÂs full support. 
Mr Berdennikov (Russian Federation), Vice-President, took the Chair. 

45. Mr MOHAMAD (Malaysia) said that his country remained troubled by the lack of significant progress on nuclear disarmament, and by the perennial problem of inadequate funding for the Agency. Recalling that a war had been launched against Iraq despite the fact that the Agency and the United Nations had provided impartial and factual information pointing to the absence of weapons of mass destruction in that country, he stressed the need to ensure that the Agency remained the sole agency for monitoring and verifying compliance with safeguards obligations. That was even more of an imperative as more countries looked to nuclear power development as a means of meeting growing energy demands and mitigating the effects of climate change. The Agency must be allowed to function without undue impediment Â political or otherwise Â since its credibility depended on its continued independence. 

46. In the area of nuclear technology applications, there was a need for a dramatic increase in funding to enable the Agency to assist developing Member States with their socio-economic development, in line with respective national priorities. 

47. He agreed that it was necessary to recognize the link between security and development, and to address the root causes of instability and insecurity, including poverty, poor governance and endemic conflicts, so as to help to remove the temptation for countries to seek weapons of mass destruction. The more developed Member States should provide greater assistance, particularly in the form of funding, for the Agency to assist the developing Member States to enhance global peace and security, while facilitating the development of those States. 

48. Malaysia emphasized the basic and inalienable right of States to develop research, production and use of atomic energy for peaceful purposes, without any discrimination and in conformity with their respective legal obligations. A clear distinction should be drawn between the legal obligations of Member States arising out of safeguards commitments, and their voluntary commitments. States should not be penalized for not adhering to their voluntary commitments. 

49. Malaysia welcomed the recent positive developments that had enabled the Agency to acquire a better understanding of the nuclear programme in Iran. In MalaysiaÂs view, Iran had extended its fullest cooperation to the Agency in accordance with its national obligations in order to resolve the Iranian nuclear issue, and the international community should now move forward. A long-term, peaceful and mutually acceptable solution could be found only through diplomacy and continued dialogue. Malaysia welcomed the Iranian initiatives to promote greater transparency, and encouraged Iran to continue its cooperation with the Agency to resolve the remaining outstanding issues. 

50. The Agency should also be allowed to resolve the issues pertaining to the implementation of the safeguards agreement in the Syrian Arab Republic without interference and undue pressure from any third party. Any States with information leading them to conclude that the installation in Syria had been nuclear-related should provide such information to the Agency immediately. Malaysia condemned any act of aggression against any nuclear installation or any installation alleged to be nuclear related, which constituted a flagrant violation of the United Nations Charter. 

51. Malaysia agreed that it would become increasingly difficult to call upon non-nuclear-weapon States to renounce nuclear weapons in perpetuity and accept new measures to strengthen nonÂ­proliferation if the nuclear-weapon States continued to modernize their arsenals. Malaysia advocated multilateral approaches towards the disarmament of weapons of mass destruction, and had consistently called for the establishment of a nuclear weapons convention. 

52. Malaysia agreed that the responsibility for nuclear security rested entirely with the Member States themselves and that the Agency should provide assistance in that regard only upon request. Care 
should be taken to ensure that there was no disproportionate focus on perceived threats to nuclear security that could result in unjustifiable denials of shipments of vital radioisotopes. His country also cautioned against linking the increasing global interest for nuclear energy to an increased perception of a threat to nuclear security. States interested in the use of nuclear energy for power generation should not be stereotyped. 
53. His country highly appreciated the AgencyÂs efforts in helping Member States to build their technical capacities for the development of nuclear technology and applications, and had benefitted in a number of areas including industry, health and agriculture. It had consistently paid in full and on time its financial contributions to the Agency, and urged other Member States to do likewise. 

54. Malaysia was open to the use of nuclear energy as a fuel option for the future, and was taking steps to assess its preparedness in that regard in accordance with relevant Agency recommendations, safety standards and guides. Although an infrastructure development plan for nuclear power was also being prepared, the specific decisions on nuclear power projects would be subject to a new national energy policy for the period 2010Â2030, which was being elaborated. His country was also developing a national nuclear policy that would serve as a guide for further development of both power and nonÂ­power applications. Some of the main elements covered included research and development of nuclear and related technologies; development of a comprehensive national nuclear legislative and regulatory framework; human capital development; transparent, accurate and timely dissemination of public information; and international cooperation. 

55. Malaysia had organized the International Nuclear Conference 2009, which it hoped had given the Agency a more objective understanding of the actual situation in Malaysia, with a view to the design of a proper technical assistance plan for the country. It welcomed the first nuclear knowledge management mission, which had been conducted in Malaysia in July. His country had also hosted an Agency meeting on developing and strengthening nuclear safety and security infrastructure in Asia and that Pacific in May 2009. 

56. Lastly, Malaysia expressed its appreciation to the outgoing Director General, Mr ElBaradei, for his admirable and professional service over the previous 12 years, and congratulated his successor, Mr Amano, on his appointment. 

57. Mr KAKODKAR (India) expressed his countryÂs gratitude to the outgoing Director General for his outstanding leadership of the Agency over the previous 12 years, and congratulated the Director General designate on his appointment. 

58. The role of atomic energy was now more relevant than ever before. Nuclear power had the potential to provide a large sustainable source of clean energy that could address the development aspirations of a large part of humanity. However, concerns regarding safety, proliferation and security, as well as uncertainty about assured fuel supplies needed to be addressed in a holistic manner before nuclear energy could meet its full potential. There was an urgent need for effective action to provide the underdeveloped areas of the world with access to means of development, and to reduce carbon dioxide emissions in order to contain human conflict and prevent climate-related disasters. The Agency and its Member States had a major responsibility in reaching universally applicable solutions accessible to all. 

59. The importance of nuclear power had been recognized by his country since its independence in 1947. IndiaÂs comprehensive atomic energy programme covered the entire fuel cycle for uranium, plutonium and thorium-based fuels, and was governed by the long-term objective of energy independence using the countryÂs vast thorium resources. There were several benefits of the thorium fuel cycle, particularly in heavy water reactors, in terms of proliferation-resistant nuclear energy production and efficient fissile plutonium disposal, which might be of interest to other countries. The 
300 MW(e) advanced heavy water reactor being developed in India was mainly a thorium-fuelled reactor with several advanced proven passive safety features. It could be managed with a modest industrial infrastructure within the reach of developing countries, and offered enhanced intrinsic proliferation-resistant characteristics. A new version of the advanced heavy water reactor that used LEU as well as thorium fuel had been designed recently. The reactor had significantly lower requirement of mined uranium per unit of energy produced compared with most current generation thermal reactors, and could meet the requirements of next generation systems in countries with small grids. 
60. With regard to the disposal of high-level radioactive waste, he said that there was a need to develop partition and transmutation technologies that reduced the radioactive half-life of waste to a level where most of the radioactivity was lost within a practical time frame. Although intense research and development was necessary, that goal could be achieved, given current levels of development and understanding. 
61. India remained committed to making a significant contribution to the growth of nuclear energy globally within the framework of the Agency. Drawing attention to some of the other achievements of the Indian nuclear power programme, he said that the En-masse feeder replacement for RAPS-2 had been completed with the highest levels of safety, using entirely indigenously developed technology. Construction of three 220 MW(e) pressurized heavy water reactors had almost been completed, and two 1000 MW(e) light water reactors and one 500 MW(e) prototype fast breeder reactor were in advanced stages of construction. The unit size of Indian pressurized heavy water reactors had been further increased to 700 MW(e), and plans had been made to install a series of such units in the country. As IndiaÂs indigenous nuclear programme was set to accelerate, India looked forward to mutually beneficial cooperation with other Member States of the Agency. It was currently reformulating its plans for larger scale programme implementation taking advantage of emerging new possibilities. Results had already been achieved, and RAPS-2 was the first operational pressurized heavy water reactor in India that used imported natural uranium. 
62. India had always attached the highest importance to INPRO, and drew attention to the need for all Member States to pool resources and experience in the best interests of humankind. However, one of the biggest limitations to the expansion of nuclear power was the lack of qualified human resources. India was willing to work with friendly developing countries to address that issue and ensure success in intensifying the use of nuclear energy. 
63. To mark the end of the centenary year of Dr Homi Bhabha, the founder of IndiaÂs atomic energy programme, an international conference on the peaceful uses of atomic energy would be held in New Delhi at the end of the month. He thanked the Agency for supporting that event. 
64. Mr ZNIBER (Morocco) commended the outgoing Director General, Mr ElBaradei, for his efforts to promote peace and security in the world, and congratulated his successor, Mr Amano, on his appointment. 
65. Morocco welcomed the opportunity to discuss the future of the Agency and noted that one of the challenges facing the Agency was the availability of financial resources. The Agency should be given all the financial resources it required in order to carry out its increasing tasks. It should also strengthen its cooperation with other international organizations. 
66. Morocco had always advocated complete disarmament, a world free of nuclear weapons, and the development of a credible verification system under the auspices of the Agency. It welcomed the opportunity to co-chair, with France, the Conference on Facilitating the Entry into Force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty in New York on 24 and 25 September 2009, and called for the rapid entry into force of the CTBT. 
67. As a party to the NPT, Morocco regretted the fact that no progress had been made over the years regarding the implementation of the resolution concerning the application of Agency safeguards in the Middle East. IsraelÂs persistent refusal to accede to the NPT constituted a serious obstacle to the creation of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East, and to the establishment of a just and lasting peace in the region. He appealed to the international community to consider, in a fair and equitable manner, the concerns associated with the deployment of nuclear weapons in the Middle East, and called on the General Conference to debate the issue. 
68. Morocco attached particular importance to the technical cooperation programme, which was an important vehicle for technology transfer, and contributed to the socio-economic development of Member States. Some 15 projects were being implemented in Morocco in the 2009Â2011 cycle in areas such as health, agriculture and industry. Two years earlier, the first Triga Mark II research reactor had become operational in Morocco, opening up extensive opportunities for cooperation at the international and regional levels, particularly through AFRA. 
69. The future of nuclear power and its acceptance by the public were to a large extent dependent on safety considerations, and he emphasized the importance of trained human resources in that connection. Since 2002, Morocco had provided high-level safety and security training for French speaking experts from Africa, with a view to enhancing the safety culture. The National Centre for Nuclear Energy, Sciences and Technology, which provided the training, was one of five designated regional training centres. 
70. Morocco was seeking to set up an international training centre in the field of nuclear sciences and technology applications. It called upon the Agency to provide greater financial assistance for postgraduate education in that field. 
71. In keeping with a basic principle of its foreign policy, Morocco supported South-South cooperation with a view to promoting safety, security and peace in the region. In December, Morocco would be hosting a meeting aimed at promoting the Joint Convention among the Arab States. 
72. Morocco welcomed the AgencyÂs efforts in the area of nuclear security, in particular through the development of programmes, such as missions to evaluate national infrastructure and nuclear safety requirements, and called on the Agency to continue providing assistance in that regard to developing countries. His country appreciated the development of the Nuclear Security Plan for 2010 
Â 2013, and called upon Member States to contribute to its implementation through the provision of voluntary contributions. 

73. The threat of nuclear terrorism was a subject to which his country attached particular importance. Morocco had hosted the first meeting of the Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism, and thanked the Agency for organizing a seminar concerning prevention of illicit trafficking of nuclear materials in June. 
74. MoroccoÂs new national energy plan provided for alternative energy options, including the nuclear power option. The development of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes should go hand in hand with nuclear safety and security measures and non-proliferation guarantees. However, such measures should not be used as a barrier to the transfer of technology for peaceful purposes. Access to nuclear technologies for exclusively peaceful purposes was an inalienable right, fully recognized in the NPT. 
75. Lastly, he called upon those Member States that had not yet done so to deposit their instruments of acceptance so that the amendment to Article VI of the Statute, which sought to increase representation on the Board of Governors, could enter into force as soon as possible. 
76. Mr ENKHBAT (Mongolia) expressed his countryÂs deep appreciation to the outgoing Director General for his many years of outstanding service to the Agency, and congratulated Mr Amano on his appointment. 
77. His country, which highly appreciated the AgencyÂs valuable support, was embarking upon a new phase in the development of its peaceful nuclear activities, having adopted a State policy and an action plan on uranium utilization and nuclear energy. The Nuclear Energy Law, which had entered into force in August 2009, regulated all issues pertaining to the exploitation of radioactive minerals, nuclear energy for peaceful purposes, nuclear and radiation safety and security, and protection of the population from the negative impacts of ionizing radiation. A nuclear energy agency had also been established by his Government. Mongolia had begun to implement recommendations made by Agency expert missions with a view to identifying possible multilateral approaches to the nuclear fuel cycle, and was satisfied with the results of missions carried out in that connection. 
78. Mongolia had indicated its continued interest in the technical cooperation programme to the Director General during his visit to Mongolia in April. In view of the increasing incidence of cancer morbidity and mortality in his country, Mongolia sought the assistance of the Agency and other international donor agencies in order to improve quality and accessibility of cancer services, and build up diagnostic and treatment capacity. Mongolia also benefited greatly from its involvement in the Agency and the RCA, and wished to expand its cooperation with the Agency in order to reflect its increasing needs in the areas of uranium development, the introduction of nuclear energy and nuclear technology transfer. He thanked the Agency for its efforts to strengthen its technical cooperation activities with Mongolia, and noted that his country had, notwithstanding its financial difficulties, made a pledge to the TCF in recognition of the value of technical cooperation activities to its development efforts. 
79. Mongolia fully supported the AgencyÂs safeguards and verification activities, and highly commended the AgencyÂs efforts in that regard. His country remained committed to nuclear nonÂ­proliferation and disarmament, and was working to ensure the success of the forthcoming NPT Review Conference. In April, it had hosted the first meeting of focal points of nuclear-weapon-free zones, at which a joint statement for the 2010 NPT Review Conference had been adopted. 
80. With regard to his countryÂs nuclear-weapon-free status, he said that Mongolia had held a trilateral meeting in Geneva with Russia and China to consider a draft trilateral treaty that would define MongoliaÂs status at the international level. He hoped that the treaty, which would institutionalize MongoliaÂs status, could be concluded shortly. 
Mr El Amin, (Sudan), Vice-President, took the Chair. 

81. Mr DÃAZ (Mexico) thanked the outgoing Director General for his invaluable work over the previous twelve years and congratulated the Director General designate, with whom Mexico looked forward to working. 

82. The Annual Report for 2008 provided an overview of the challenges the Agency had faced. It was important that the Agency continue to maintain a balance among the three pillars of its work. It must also continue to ensure the safety of the various peaceful applications of nuclear energy for the benefit of humankind. 

83. Mexico welcomed the improvements in monitoring the implementation of the technical cooperation programme and supported the development of a single information system. The results of programmes should be assessed according to the national and regional impact of projects rather than by the funds spent. His country particularly supported the efforts made to strengthen the programme and departmental management procedures with a view to achieving development targets established 
by the international community, and noted that it was contributing to the attainment of the MDGs in areas such as nutrition, maternal health and water resources management. 
84. The project to improve water resources management at Guanajuato using isotope hydrology was progressing well, and local authorities had contributed some US$ 2 million for its implementation. In addition, the programme to increase the power of the two reactors at the Laguna Verde Nuclear Power Plant from 650 to 770 MW(e) over the coming two years was progressing satisfactorily. In accordance with the Agency policy of promoting regional associations to improve the use of research reactors, MexicoÂs National Nuclear Research Institute had signed the agreement of the parties of the Caribbean Research Reactor Coalition in September 2008. 

85. Mexico welcomed the work of the Agency in 2008 on promoting and supporting the global nuclear safety and security regime. His country supported the Agency's activities aimed at securing nuclear materials and facilities and radioactive sources and at strengthening States' legislation and regulations as part of the measures to prevent nuclear terrorism. 

86. Mexico had received an INSServ mission in December 2008, which had visited the major ports and airports where the majority of goods entered the country. Mexico welcomed the assistance provided by the Agency to help Member States strengthen their capacity for effective border controls in order to prevent the illicit import and export of nuclear and other radioactive materials. 

87. His country welcomed the AgencyÂs publication of guides on various subjects and would continue to contribute through comments and experts to the preparation of further documents in the safety standards series. Mexico also participated in the illicit trafficking database, with the National Commission on Nuclear Safety and Safeguards acting as the national contact point. His Government had also asked the Agency for assistance in installing detection equipment for use during the Pan American Games in 2011. 

88. It was regrettable that States had not achieved the non-proliferation objectives set out in international instruments, in particular the NPT. The risk of proliferation would be greatly reduced by significant progress towards total disarmament in a transparent, verifiable and irreversible way. The United Nations Security Council Summit on Nuclear Non-Proliferation and Nuclear Disarmament on 24 September 2009 would provide a further opportunity to raise the issue of the total elimination of nuclear weapons. He urged those countries that had not yet acceded to the NPT to do so, and appealed to all States party to that Treaty to comply fully with their obligations. 

89. The AgencyÂs efforts to develop a safeguards system that ensured compliance with the nuclear non-proliferation regime would be in vain if it were not backed by the political will of States. Mexico was in full compliance with its safeguards obligations and supported all the AgencyÂs efforts to ensure an effective, efficient and universal safeguards system. His country was grateful to the outgoing Director General for his work in the area of verification and urged all countries to demonstrate their cooperation and support to those activities. 

90. Mexico reiterated its call for the resumption of the six-party talks to promote the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula and to bring the DPRK back into the NPT regime. It welcomed the Islamic Republic of IranÂs recent cooperation with the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council and Germany and encouraged the Government of Iran to work actively with the Agency in order to clarify the outstanding issues and to provide assurances of the exclusively peaceful nature of its nuclear programme. 

91. Following difficult negotiations, the Board of Governors had approved the AgencyÂs programme and budget for 2010. Consideration should be given to how the tasks entrusted to the Agency were to be funded. For example, the signing by more States of an additional protocol, 
although desirable, would lead to verification costs. The expansion of the nuclear industry in various countries would also have financial implications. The operation and application of international safeguards and their funding should be reviewed to ensure that the financial load was distributed fairly in a way that also took account of the benefits countries derived from their nuclear industry. 
92. Like many developing countries, Mexico attached importance to the benefits of the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. The international community must find the balance between ensuring security and providing for the fullest possible exchange of equipment, materials and scientific and technological information in accordance with Article IV of the NPT. It was now necessary to make new commitments that could go beyond the letter of that Treaty. Confidence must be built on the basis of genuine commitments that would enable an effective response to the threats that had emerged in recent times. 

93. Ms RASI (Finland) expressed her delegationÂs gratitude to Mr ElBaradei for the outstanding manner in which he had carried out his tasks over the past 12 years. She also conveyed her GovernmentÂs congratulations to the incoming Director General, and assured him of FinlandÂs full support. 

94. Well-functioning verification and safeguards were a prerequisite for public confidence in the use of nuclear energy in the longer term. It was important to ensure that the Agency could continue its professional and impartial work in safeguards implementation and had sufficient financial and other resources for its verification activities in the future. Finland was strongly in favour of strengthening the efficiency and effectiveness of the Agency's safeguards system. Comprehensive safeguards agreements and additional protocols, which constituted the current verification standard, should be brought promptly into force and implemented in all Member States. 

95. In Finland, the experience gained from the implementation of integrated safeguards, which had started about one year previously, had been most encouraging. The requirement for Finland to provide the Agency with extensive information on all aspects of its nuclear fuel cycle had proved less burdensome than expected, and after the preparation of the first declaration, updating it had been straightforward. The Agency had been given broader rights to access facilities and to use advanced verification technologies without any problems, and the overall number of annual Agency inspection missions to Finland had decreased by about 60 %. Finland would welcome and support the further use of state-of-the-art verification technologies to provide quick and reliable results. It was also in favour of the Agency taking more practical steps to enhance cooperation with the SSAC. 

96. Work on building an underground final disposal facility in Finland for spent nuclear fuel was at an advanced stage, and high priority being given to the development of a safeguards system for a geological repository for spent fuel. The implementation of safeguards in a new type of facility was necessary at national and international level. Her delegation was pleased to note that the Agency had drafted integrated safeguards approaches for the spent fuel encapsulation plants and for the repositories, and that major progress had been made in devising an integral safeguards approach to the repository. 

97. Interest in the use of nuclear power was growing, and the challenges facing the Agency in all its activities had increased accordingly. Finland had more than 30 years of experience in the operation of nuclear power plants and a reliable safety and performance record. A new unit was under construction to add to the four existing nuclear power plant units, and three companies had submitted applications to build a new nuclear power plant unit. A decision in principle, taken by the Government and endorsed by the Parliament, was needed before the actual construction of the new plant could begin. 

98. Nuclear power would play a significant role in the energy mix of Finland well into the future, and was expected to meet more than 35 % of the countryÂs electricity needs. Finland aimed to achieve 
a diversified and sustainable energy mix, and the share of renewables was now close to 30 % of energy consumption. The promotion of renewable energy, energy efficiency and self-sufficiency was an important part of FinlandÂs energy strategy. 
99. Public acceptance of nuclear power needed to be earned every day, and was to a great extent related to nuclear safety. Any major plant damage anywhere in the world could have a major impact on public acceptance. Continued safe operation of nuclear power was necessary, and there could be no exception in any Member State. The Agency was a major player in those efforts; with so many countries planning to introduce nuclear power, its role would become even more important. Member States and the Agency should strengthen and coordinate their efforts to ensure that countries embarking on nuclear power programmes developed sound safety infrastructures. Notwithstanding the Agency's central role in contributing to conditions that permitted the safe and secure use of nuclear energy, ultimately responsibility lay with national authorities and operators. The Agency could not be expected to assume the responsibilities of national authorities. Finland underlined the importance of a strong national safety culture and an independent national regulatory authority that enjoyed public trust. It continued to actively share with other countries its experience in building national infrastructures and making the arrangements needed to ensure the safety of nuclear power plants. 

100. Finland appreciated the AgencyÂs work in developing modern safety standards and was ready to continue providing expert resources to that end. It was a party to all international safety conventions and had participated actively in their review meetings. Her delegation called on all countries to accede to the safety conventions and apply the relevant obligations in full. 

101. Her delegation underlined the importance of the nuclear waste management issue and noted that the Finnish nuclear waste management and disposal programme had progressed over time. A clearly defined waste management policy and sound financing arrangements set out in nuclear legislation were essential. 

102. The Finnish fuel cycle was based on the once-through option. In accordance with national legislation, spent nuclear fuel was considered to be radioactive waste which must be disposed of in bedrock. The lengthy site selection and concept development, including environmental impact assessments, had resulted in a plan for a final disposal in Olkiluoto. The nuclear waste management company Posiva was conducting an extensive programme to prepare for the submission of an application for a construction licence in 2012. The construction of an underground rock characterization facility, which was to operate as part of the final repository, had started in July 2004. At the end of August 2009, the facilityÂs access tunnel had nearly reached final repository depth. Fuel disposal was scheduled to start in 2020. 

103. Her delegation welcomed the progress made in the field of nuclear security. With regard to the amendment to the CPPNM, Finland had completed the necessary amendments to national legislation and was ready to deposit its instrument of ratification. It called for an early ratification by all States of the amendment to the CPPNM and of the International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism so as to strengthen the global nuclear security regime. Finland supported the AgencyÂs important role in the fight against nuclear terrorism, and would be making another voluntary contribution to the NSF. 

104. An IPPAS mission had visited Finland in June 2009, and many of the useful recommendations made by the review team were being implemented. Finland recommended those missions to other Member States as an effective way of obtaining guidance on enhancing the physical security of nuclear materials and facilities and radioactive sources. 

105. Finland recognized the importance of the AgencyÂs technical cooperation programme. It had always paid its contributions to the regular budget and its share of the TCF target in full and on time, 
and called on all Member States to do likewise. The Agency must be able to respond to the increasing demand for technical cooperation activities relating to the introduction of nuclear power, particularly in the area of safety. Accordingly, technical cooperation must be developed further: the most efficient ways of transferring knowledge and technology should be utilized, and emphasis should be on longÂ­term capacity building. 
106. Projects under the technical cooperation programme should be in conformity with the Agency's terms of reference and based on national development strategies. Finland recognized the important role of non-power applications relating to technical cooperation and assistance. It urged the Agency to continue to elaborate more cost-effective and sustainable methods and partnerships with other organizations, such as WHO and FAO to ensure that the different areas of expertise of other international organizations were put to the service of recipient countries in a coordinated, effective and sustainable manner. 
107. Mr HAMER (Netherlands) commended the leadership and dedication displayed by the outgoing Director General, and pledged his countryÂs full support to Mr ElBaradei's successor, Mr Amano. 
108. It was a challenging time for the nuclear non-proliferation regime. The ongoing efforts by the DRPK to produce nuclear weapons, IranÂs lack of cooperation in allowing the Agency to verify the peaceful nature of its nuclear programme, and the outstanding questions regarding SyriaÂs nuclear programme, as well as the danger of nuclear material falling into the hands of terrorists and other non-State actors were matters of grave concern which required action. However, the call by United States President Obama for a world without nuclear weapons had inspired a new international effort to create a strengthened non-proliferation regime. 
109. There was scope for further strengthening of the AgencyÂs safeguards system. A comprehensive safeguards agreement together with an additional protocol constituted the verification standard. He called upon all Member States to conclude, ratify and implement those two instruments. The verification powers granted to the Agency under an additional protocol were essential for building trust and thus contributed to enhanced nuclear cooperation. A strengthened nuclear safeguards system benefited everyone. However, merely strengthening safeguards was not enough: a strong policy against non-compliance was essential in order to guarantee the integrity of the NPT and the AgencyÂs inspection regime. 
110. Nuclear terrorism was one of the biggest threats to international security. He welcomed the initiative of the United States to host a nuclear security summit in 2010. The summit should aim to achieve maximum synergy between existing international instruments and avoid duplication. His country had hosted the fifth plenary meeting of the Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism in June 2009. An international exercise on the prevention of nuclear terrorism was planned for later in the year. The Agency was fully involved in both events. 
111. The Nuclear Security Fund was an important instrument for improving nuclear security. Multilateral cooperation would maximize the efficiency and hence the effectiveness of international efforts. The Fund should eventually be financed from the Agency's regular budget but, until then, all Member States, not just a few donors, should contribute to it. His own country had pledged a further donation of Â250 000 for 2010. 
112. An IPPAS mission had visited the Netherlands in June 2009 and had reviewed the national regulatory body and all nuclear installations in the country. A follow-up mission would take place in 2010 to consider the implementation of the recommendations and suggestions. A regional training course for security regulators would be held later in 2009, in collaboration with the Agency and the European Nuclear Security RegulatorsÂ Association, which, it was hoped, would lead to the establishment of a permanent European training centre. 
113. Turning to nuclear science and technology, he said that many previous speakers had voiced serious concerns about the shortage of medical radioisotopes. His country was the second-largest producer of those isotopes, but the relevant reactor had been shut down in August 2008 following technical problems. Because of the global implications of a lengthy halt in production, the operator had requested permission to restart production while repairs were under way. The national regulatory body and an Agency review mission had judged the proposed safety measures to be adequate, and permission had been granted for the reactor to restart operation for one year. Close cooperation between Member States, the Agency and other relevant international organizations was important in order to manage the vulnerable global supply of medical radioisotopes, on which so many patients depended around the world. 
114. His Government was pleased to note that the Reactor Institute Delft had been designated an Agency Collaborating Centre, one of 13 throughout the world. 
115. Turning to technical cooperation, he said that his country provided technical expertise, specialized equipment and training, and supported R&D on critical development issues. The AgencyÂs technical cooperation activities were an important catalyst for sustainable development. His country had pledged its full share of the target for 2010 and called upon Member States that had not yet made their pledges to do so as soon as possible. He commended the Secretariat on the progress it had made in streamlining the technical cooperation programme, but felt that the programme's effectiveness would be further improved by increasing the coherence between the various projects and activities. That task would be a priority of his countryÂs term on the Board of Governors. 
116. An increasing number of States had decided that nuclear power should form part of their national energy mix, which presupposed access to a secure supply of nuclear fuel. That issue must be addressed if nuclear power generation was to develop in accordance with the highest standards of safety, security and non-proliferation. His country had always supported multilateral approaches to the nuclear fuel cycle. The proposals made thus far were a valuable contribution to the realization of the right of States to use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. His country would continue to seek a dialogue with all the parties concerned. 
117. His country attached great importance to the discussions on the future of the Agency. It was for Member States to decide on the role and tasks of the Secretariat and the tools it should have at its disposal. However, in view of the resurgence of interest in nuclear power as an energy source, the Agency must have the financial and other resources it needed to fulfil its mandate. 
118. In his own country, the increasing urgency of climate change and the scarcity of energy resources made it essential to consider the future place of nuclear power in the national fuel mix. His Government did not expect to make any decisions about the construction of new nuclear power plants during its current term of office. However, it was working on three possible scenarios, ranging from the complete phasing-out of nuclear energy to the commissioning of new power plants, which should help a future government to reach an informed decision. 
119. Mr POTTS (Australia) said that Australia had a strong record as a creative and energetic member of the international community working towards improving global peace and security. Its Government, determined to continue in that tradition, had announced that Australia would seek election as a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council in 2012, for the term 2013Â2014. 
120. In the field of non-proliferation and disarmament, Australia had been at the forefront of efforts to reduce the threat posed by nuclear weapons. Australia had rejected the option of becoming a nuclear-weapon State and had signed the NPT in 1970. In the 1990s, the Government had convened the Canberra Commission on the Elimination of Nuclear Weapons and had made a significant 
contribution to the negotiation of the CTBT. In 2008, Australia had, together with Japan, established the International Commission on Nuclear Non-Proliferation and Disarmament with a view to generating momentum in the global debate on nuclear disarmament and preventing the further spread of nuclear weapons. The CommissionÂs major report, expected by early 2010, would aim to build international consensus in advance of the 2010 NPT Review Conference. Australia was also working with others to achieve an outcome from the Review Conference that would reinforce and build on previous consensus. Australia had been chairing the ÂVienna Group of TenÂ, a group of States committed to producing text on safeguards and verification, safety and security, and peaceful uses, to assist the NPT review process. 
121. Member States of the Agency had a common interest in ensuring an effective Agency safeguards system. The assurance that the safeguards system was effective, not least in terms of public confidence, was a central part of the NPT, providing the foundation for nuclear trade and cooperation, and was also important to continuing progress on nuclear disarmament. He welcomed the fact that safeguards authorities in the Asia-Pacific region had agreed at a meeting in the Republic of Korea in April 2009 to establish the Asia-Pacific Safeguards Network, which would commence on 1 October 2009. Working closely with the Agency, the Network aimed to improve the quality, effectiveness and efficiency of safeguards implementation in the region through enhanced cooperation via capacity building, professional development and the sharing of experience. The Director General of the Australian Safeguards and Non-Proliferation Office had been elected the first chair of the Network. The NetworkÂs Statement of Principles would be circulated as a GOV/INF document. 
122. Emphasising the importance of expanding the coverage of Agency safeguards, he encouraged NPT parties that had yet to fulfil their obligations under the Treaty to conclude comprehensive safeguards agreements as soon as possible, and welcomed the conclusion of comprehensive safeguards agreements and additional protocols by the Republic of the Congo, Kenya and Vanuatu. Australia trusted that safeguards coverage would increase through the universalization of the NPT, and encouraged those States that had not signed and ratified the Treaty to do so as soon as possible. Safeguarding all nuclear activities in every State was vital to building a nuclear-weapon-free world. 
123. Australia also urged Member States to recognize that the AgencyÂs core mission was to develop and strengthen the safeguards system to meet contemporary challenges. Agency inspectors required the necessary support and authority to fulfil their mission, a goal which Australia promoted with the Agency through the Australian safeguards support programme and through its membership of SAGSI. 
124. The additional protocol was an integral part of the contemporary verification standard. Without it, the Agency could not draw conclusions about the absence of undeclared nuclear activities in States. He therefore strongly encouraged all States, particularly those with significant nuclear activities, yet to sign, ratify and implement an additional protocol, to do so as soon as possible. Such action would contribute greatly to global security, and should not be viewed as a burdensome new commitment, bargaining chip, or concession conditional on other StatesÂ actions. 
125. It was important for States to comply with their safeguards obligations and for Member States to hold each other to account for safeguards violations. Any notion that Agency safeguards were voluntary in character should be rejected. Under the NPT, non-nuclear-weapon States parties had made a binding commitment to use nuclear energy only for peaceful purposes. Safeguards agreements were the means of verifying that commitment and established obligations that were binding in international law. 
126. Any additional legal obligations created by United Nations Security Council resolutions were appropriate given the special status of the Agency with respect to the Security Council. Failure to be vigilant in cases of actual or possible non-compliance would erode the credibility of the safeguards 
system and the global security architecture it supported. In that context, Australia, while acknowledging some recent instances of cooperation with the Agency, remained deeply concerned that the Islamic Republic of Iran continued to act in violation of binding Security Council resolutions and Board of GovernorsÂ requirements, and in a manner inconsistent with its safeguards obligations. He expressed particular concern that Iran had not cooperated with the Agency in addressing information that pointed to possible military dimensions to its nuclear programme, and he encouraged Iran to clarify and resolve those issues with the Agency and to engage in productive dialogue, including on nuclear issues, with the permanent members of the Security Council and Germany. 
127. Agency assessments had increased concerns about the likelihood that the Syrian Arab Republic had been conducting undeclared nuclear activities, including construction of a reactor with assistance from the DPRK. Such undeclared activities would be in breach of SyriaÂs safeguards obligations, and its refusal to cooperate fully with the Agency in investigating the issues compounded concerns. Australia supported the AgencyÂs continuing efforts to establish the truth of the matter and urged Syria to cooperate in that regard. 
128. Australia profoundly regretted the DPRKÂs unilateral announcement of withdrawal from the NPT, and that countryÂs non-compliance with its safeguards obligations, its decision to cease all cooperation with the Agency, and its defiance of Security Council resolutions. He urged the DPRK to abandon nuclear weapons and its nuclear programmes in a complete, verifiable and irreversible manner, and to comply with the NPT, its Agency safeguards agreement, and all relevant Security Council resolutions. The Conference must send a clear message to the DPRK that its actions were not acceptable. 
129. Australia attached great importance to nuclear safety and security, and worked closely with the Agency and regional neighbours on such issues. As a major uranium producer and exporter, it recognized the importance of implementing best practice standards in uranium mining and processing. Australia had been pleased to host a meeting during the present session of the General Conference concerning prospects and challenges for uranium production. It also attached great importance to the safe, reliable and timely transport of radioactive materials, which had an essential role in medical, scientific and industrial applications, and supported the activities of the International Steering Committee on Denial of Shipments of Radioactive Material. Denials or delays had a serious impact on the shipment of short-lived medical isotopes, and had the potential to significantly exacerbate current supply shortages. Australia hoped to work with the Agency and others to find practical solutions. 
130. Australia was a strong supporter of the Agency's nuclear security programme and had made a further contribution of 450 000 Australian dollars to the NSF in 2009. His country worked closely with the Agency to develop guidance, training courses and security-related missions. In 2009, it had hosted regional training courses on security in the transport of radioactive material and on physical protection of research reactors, and had chaired an Agency meeting on the long-term management of disused and orphan radioactive sources. It also cooperated with its neighbours to identify and secure high-risk radioactive sources and enhance legislation, infrastructure and security culture. Australia looked forward to making a strong contribution to the global nuclear security summit to be convened by the United States of America in 2010. 
131. Australia affirmed the right of Agency Member States to enjoy the benefits of peaceful uses of nuclear energy in accordance with their international obligations, and took seriously its undertaking to facilitate the exchange of equipment, materials and scientific and technological information for such purposes. Australia held between 30% and 40% of the worldÂs uranium reserves and was a major supplier to the global nuclear power industry. In 2008, it had ranked among the top dozen contributors to the TCF, and contributed extrabudgetary funds to the RCA. The Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (ANSTO) was a designated Agency collaborating centre for neutron 
scattering applications and had hosted the second Asia-Oceania Neutron Scattering Association neutron school in August 2009. 
132. In relation to the continuing shortage of molybdenum-99, Australia was pleased to report that routine operation of the molybdenum-99 facility associated with its OPAL research reactor had been given full regulatory approval, and commercial production had commenced. ANSTO would be able to supply the domestic market, and was looking to increase production for export in an effort to mitigate the global shortfall. Australia participated in the high-level group established by the OECD/NEA to address the shortage in the longer term and recognized the strong role the Agency could play in that regard. 
133. In closing, he expressed deep appreciation of the outgoing Director GeneralÂs excellent service to the Agency and commitment to improving international peace and the contribution of nuclear technology to economic development, human health and well-being. He also congratulated the incoming Director General, with whom Australia looked forward to working closely. 
134. Mr ALHAMADI (Qatar) commended the outgoing Director General on his outstanding performance over the past 12 years, during which the Agency had achieved major advances in all areas covered by its mandate. The General ConferenceÂs decision to confer on Dr ElBaradei the title of Director General Emeritus of the Agency was a well-deserved honour. He also welcomed the incoming Director General, Mr Amano, and wished him every success. 
135. Qatar had established a national task force to oversee the drafting of special legislation required by the institutions that would manage and organize the countryÂs use of nuclear technology for various civilian purposes. The task force would also ensure that qualified human resources were on hand to run the relevant national institutions. It was hoped to enact and enforce the legislation in the near future. 
136. Qatar was currently working on its framework agreement for technical cooperation with the Agency, and hoped to prepare, adopt and implement its framework strategy in 2010 with the assistance of Agency experts. The experts were also applying Agency expertise to the organization of border surveillance in order to guarantee full control over imports and exports of radioactive material. 
137. With a view to ensuring full transparency of its activities related to nuclear energy, Qatar had signed a safeguards agreement and a Small Quantities Protocol with the Agency in 2009. 
138. At their summit in Doha in 2009, the Arab leaders had adopted a resolution reaffirming the right of the Arab States to use nuclear energy for development purposes as well as an Arab nuclear energy strategy for the period 2010Â2020. Basing itself on that resolution, Qatar was focusing on cooperation among the Arab States, through existing national, regional and international institutions, with a view to making full use of their potential and expertise in the area of peaceful applications of nuclear energy in support of national development goals. 
139. Qatar was also participating through the Gulf Cooperation Council in the implementation of the detailed studies required to build an infrastructure for peaceful uses of nuclear energy and to implement technical cooperation projects that had been agreed with the Agency. His country looked forward to further cooperation with the Agency in that context. 
140. Qatar was deeply concerned about the AgencyÂs continued inability to implement the comprehensive safeguards regime in States that had not acceded to the NPT. The resulting imbalance in the Middle East posed a threat to regional and international peace and security. All States in the region had acceded to the NPT except Israel, which remained outside the NPT regime despite its possession of a nuclear arsenal with huge destructive potential. The situation was a source of instability in the region and encouraged States to seek ways of redressing the imbalance. 
141. Unilateral action in the form of attacks on installations in other States prompted solely by suspicions regarding their activities was unacceptable. Any State that possessed data regarding undeclared activities should behave responsibly and make the information available to the Agency so that it could undertake an investigation. The international community could then take appropriate measures to rectify the situation in the light of the highly credible information produced by the Agency. 
142. Qatar noted with satisfaction recent steps to launch a dialogue between the United States and the Islamic Republic of Iran to settle the Iranian nuclear issue and dispel the tensions overshadowing the Gulf region. His country urged the two States to take the opportunity to resolve all outstanding issues in a spirit of responsibility in order to preclude a confrontation with unpredictable consequences. 
143. The time had come to acknowledge that the welfare of humankind lay in cooperation rather than confrontation and in good neighbourliness rather than war. Qatar strongly supported the aim of creating a zone free of weapons of mass destruction, particularly nuclear weapons, in the Middle East and the implementation of the Security Council, General Assembly and NPT Review Conference resolutions concerning non-proliferation. 
144. Mr TÃTH (Preparatory Commission for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization) said that the Agency was starting a new era with the appointment of the new Director General. He wished Ambassador Amano every success as he prepared to face the many complex challenges that lay ahead. He also paid tribute to the outgoing Director GeneralÂs many years of outstanding service to international peace and security. As Director General Emeritus of the Agency, Dr ElBaradei would continue to carry his message of peace, and contribute to the realization of the dream of a world free of nuclear weapons. 
145. A successful outcome of the forthcoming NPT Review Conference was critical for the continued success of the multilateral nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament regime. Progress on the CTBT was one of the areas where consensus could be built in advance of the 2010 Review Conference. The CTBT was a strong complement to the NPT; entry into force of the Treaty would signal a commitment to disarmament, strengthened non-proliferation, and facilitate the peaceful use of nuclear energy. The CTBTOÂs own high-level conference on facilitating the entry into force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty would be taking place on 24 and 25 September with the participation of foreign ministers from some 100 countries, and the final declaration was expected to set out a strategy for the entry into force of the Treaty. The outcome documents of previous Article XIV conferences had always been adopted by consensus, even in the case of the 2005 Conference, which had taken place only a few weeks after the 2005 NPT Review Conference. The CTBT had therefore always been a uniting issue, even at difficult moments for the multilateral non-proliferation regime. 
146. The CTBT boasted a near-universal membership:181 countries had signed the Treaty. The number of ratifications now stood at 149, bringing the Commission closer to the benchmark of 150 ratifications, which was an outstanding achievement. However, 9 of the 44 nuclear technology-capable States were still required to ratify the Treaty before it could enter into force. Although the prospects for the entry into force of the Treaty appeared much more positive than they had in the past, leadership and determined action by the international community were sorely needed to go the last mile. 
147. The Commission had built up a one billion dollar verification system, and almost 80% of the International Monitoring SystemÂs global monitoring stations were already sending operationalÂ­standard data to the CTBTO headquarters in Vienna. The volume of the data transmitted from the stations to the data centre in Vienna had tripled over the last five years. A new global communications infrastructure for relaying that data had been installed, and important advances had been made 
concerning processing methods and software. The deplorable test explosions by the DPRK in 2006 and 2009 had proved the reliability of the system. The system had also gained the trust and approval of the scientific community in the context of a 500 scientist-strong scientific studies project. 
148. There were several indications that a nuclear renaissance was imminent. More and more States would master the nuclear fuel cycle to satisfy the legitimate growing demands of their economic development, as well as to combat climate change and global warming. The amount of fissile material in circulation therefore would increase significantly, and the international community needed to put in place a robust, reliable and proven protection system. The anticipated nuclear renaissance must go hand in hand with the strengthening of the relevant legal regimes, and with the development of mechanisms to prevent the misuse of fissile material. To that end, he called for the entry into force of a fissile material cut-off treaty, the application of comprehensive safeguards and an additional protocol as the verification standard, tighter export controls, and multilateral fuel assurances. The entry into force of the CTBT was also a logical and necessary step to ensure that current and future nuclear nonÂ­proliferation challenges were addressed credibly.

8. 	General debate and Annual Report for 2008 (continued) (GC(53)/7) 

1. Mr SMITH (United Kingdom) said that the 2009 General Conference was meeting at a time when the nuclear question was central to the great and interconnected challenges of global society: global security, getting the global economy back on track, climate change and energy needs, global poverty and the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. Guided by that conviction, in its Road to 2010 policy document published in July, the United Kingdom had set out a vision of how it thought the international community could best address those nuclear-related issues in the coming years and how best to focus international efforts. 
2. The Agency was at the forefront of international efforts to deliver a safe, secure and proliferationÂfree nuclear future. It was essential for it to maintain and strengthen its work in that regard. The United Kingdom therefore welcomed the lively and constructive discussions that had taken place during 2009 within the framework of the informal and open-ended process on the future of the Agency and the role it should play in 2020 and beyond. 
3. Nuclear power was a proven technology which generated low-carbon electricity. It was affordable, dependable, safe and capable of increasing diversity of energy supply. It was an essential part of any global solution to the challenges of climate change and energy security. His country did not seek to persuade other countries to develop nuclear power Â that was a decision for independent sovereign Governments. However, it noted the recent upward revision by the Agency of its nuclear power projections, and it proceeded from the firm assumption that the coming years would see a significant increase in the use of nuclear energy. It was determined to engage in that new phase of nuclear energy in a way which maximized the opportunities and minimized the risks. 
4. One of the areas in which the United Kingdom sought to make a contribution was on the question of assurances of fuel supply. The nuclear fuel assurance proposal it had presented the preceding week to the Board of Governors was part of that effort. It facilitated access to nuclear energy, sparing countries the huge cost and technological challenge involved in establishing their own nuclear fuel cycle, while addressing existing concerns over security of supply of nuclear fuel services. As the Director General had said in his introductory statement to the Board of Governors in the preceding week, the United Kingdom proposal was fully consistent with the right to the peaceful uses of nuclear energy enshrined in Article IV of the NPT. His country remained open to and would welcome further comments and advice from Member States on its proposal as it continued to shape the concept into an effective mechanism ready for implementation. 
5. As more States were now considering a nuclear power programme or seeking to expand an existing one, his country was convinced that the time was right to ensure that multilateral approaches to the nuclear fuel cycle were developed jointly by supplier and customer States, to provide attractive and robust options that would contribute to meeting increased nuclear fuel supply requirements in the long term. 
6. A number of other proposals were also on the table, which the United Kingdom welcomed, because customer States should be able to choose from the widest possible range of nonÂ­discriminatory options to ensure the closest fit to their individual needs. 
7. The Agency had a key role to play in that regard as an objective guide, standard setter and monitor. In that connection, he welcomed the launch of the AgencyÂs INIR service. 
8. In 2008, he had reported to the General Conference on the publication by his Government of a White Paper on nuclear energy. That paper had confirmed that the United Kingdom saw nuclear power as an essential part of its energy mix for a more secure and prosperous low-carbon Britain. With the objective of enabling companies to begin operation of new nuclear power stations between 2017 and 2020, the United Kingdom had taken active steps over the preceding year to establish and consolidate the right policy framework and create the right conditions in the country for investment in new nuclear power stations. 
9. With regard to the question of regulation, his Government was currently conducting a public consultation on a proposal to restructure the organizational framework of its national nuclear regulation. The idea was to create a new sector-specific independent regulator with its own predominantly non-executive governing board that had clear lines of accountability to central government. It would have responsibility for safety, security, safeguards and transport functions and would enjoy enhanced autonomy. That would build on existing regulatory strengths to create a modern organization that was empowered to meet the challenges of the changing nuclear environment. 
10. In light of the potential nuclear renaissance worldwide, the United Kingdom was seeking to minimize the proliferation risks that could arise from an expansion of nuclear power. In that connection, enhancing the AgencyÂs safeguards capabilities was of the utmost priority. His country urged non-nuclear weapons States that had not yet done so to conclude and bring into force a comprehensive safeguards agreement and an additional protocol and, whenever relevant, to amend their SQP. It endorsed the opinion expressed by the Director General at the June meetings of the Board that, without the additional protocol, the Agency could not do its work in a credible way. It did not underestimate the technical challenges that the implementation of safeguards might entail for some countries and it remained ready, with the Agency and other Member States, to share with requesting countries best practice and expertise on safeguards implementation. 
11. During the third meeting of the Preparatory Committee for the 2010 NPT Review Conference, the Agency had repeatedly called on Member States and NPT State Parties to respond to the need for improvement of its technical capabilities. The United Kingdom had been assisting Agency safeguards since 1981 through its national safeguards support programme. It was keen to update and improve the programme and encouraged the Agency to make greater use of the support it provided and of its facilities and expertise, including with respect to increased training of existing and new safeguards inspectors. 
12. In addition, the safeguards regime should be continuously reviewed to ensure that it remained fit for its purpose. Continued concerns regarding non-compliant and non-cooperative States indicated that it might be time to initiate an international discussion on what additional powers of inspection the Agency should be given in the future. 
13. The Director GeneralÂs recent report on Iran made it clear once again that Iran was continuing its enrichment-related activities in defiance of United Nations Security Council resolutions. Iran had belatedly agreed to allow Agency access to the heavy-water research reactor at Arak and to improve monitoring at Natanz. Those small and belated steps only highlighted the many areas in which Iran was not fulfilling its responsibilities. The Director General had noted that Iran had not cooperated with the Agency on outstanding issues with a possible military dimension for over a year. 
14. Implementation by Iran of the additional protocol, and the fulfilment of its commitments under the provisions of the modified Code 3.1 of its Subsidiary Arrangements, were essential steps if confidence was to be established in the peaceful nature of its nuclear programme. The United 
Kingdom called again on Iran to comply without qualification with its safeguards obligations and to submit outstanding design information as requested by the Agency, including in relation to the nuclear power plant to be built at Darkhovin. 
15. His country urged the DPRK to fulfil its NPT obligations, resume cooperation with the Agency, refrain from further provocative actions and re-engage in dialogue with the international community. Actions that breached Security Council resolutions and NPT obligations undermined regional security and further isolated the DPRK. 
16. It was of the utmost importance for the international community to ensure that terrorist groups did not acquire and use nuclear devices. The threat was real, which was why the international community should recognize nuclear security as a fourth pillar of the global nuclear non-proliferation framework. The Agency had a key role to play in that area as well. 
17. By helping Member States to improve regulatory infrastructures and border monitoring, enhancing national capabilities and reducing the risk by securing radioactive sources, the nuclear security programme had already achieved considerable success. However, assessment and evaluation missions had identified the need for further improvements by many Member States. 
18. The Agency had a vital role to play in matching Member StatesÂ nuclear security requirements with the capacity and expertise of other Member States, facilitating a multilateral assistance relationship between them. 
19. Building on its existing good work, the Agency was also in a unique position to ensure that all Member States with fissile material fulfilled their responsibility to ensure that it was fully secure. As was underlined in its Road to 2010 paper, the United Kingdom was eager to see a strengthening in the longer term of the AgencyÂs role in securing adherence to Agency security guidelines beyond the current voluntary arrangements. 
20. His country welcomed the agreement reached on the extension of the nuclear security programme through the Nuclear Security Plan 2010Â2013, which provided a sound basis for enhanced cooperation with other countries on those issues. To underscore its support for the programme, it had contributed a further Â£4 million to the Nuclear Security Fund in 2009. 
21. Mr ERTAY (Turkey) said that the General Conference had adopted a substantial agenda, reflecting the growing relevance of the Agency in the complex global security environment. Since its foundation, the Agency had made great strides in international nuclear cooperation and had greatly contributed to the maintenance of international peace and security, as well as to the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. Now, when the international community was facing diverse challenges with respect to the future of disarmament, non-proliferation and the peaceful uses of nuclear energy, the role of the Agency in maximizing the contribution of nuclear technology to human well-being, while minimizing the risks of proliferation, was more significant than ever. 
22. Turkey was fully committed to the NPT and its three pillars of nuclear disarmament, nonÂ­proliferation and the promotion of peaceful uses of nuclear energy, each of which was of equal importance. It advocated global disarmament and supported international arms control, nonÂ­proliferation and disarmament efforts. It was party to all international non-proliferation instruments and export control regimes and fully supported their implementation. 
23. The AgencyÂs safeguards system formed an essential part of the nuclear non-proliferation regime. The universal adoption and implementation of comprehensive safeguards agreements and additional protocols was a prerequisite for an effective and credible safeguards system. Turkey therefore supported the universalization of the additional protocol as the current verification standard. 
It attached great importance to the effectiveness of the AgencyÂs safeguards system and appreciated the meticulous manner in which the Secretariat pursued verification activities under its mandate. 
24. His country noted with satisfaction that the Agency continued to verify the non-diversion of declared nuclear material in Iran. However, it also noted that the Agency was still unable to provide credible assurances regarding the absence of undeclared nuclear material and activities in that country. 
25. It was important that the outstanding issues relating to IranÂs nuclear programme be addressed in a constructive and transparent manner and brought to a positive conclusion without further delay. As a neighbour of Iran, Turkey was prepared to contribute to the resolution of the ongoing crisis of confidence between Iran and the international community through peaceful and diplomatic means. 
26. With regard to the implementation of NPT safeguards in Syria, his country considered it essential that all parties display full transparency with a view to assisting the Agency to conclude its verification activities without further complications. Turkey trusted that continued engagement of and with Syria would help the Agency eliminate ambiguities and resolve the issue. 
27. Turkey found regrettable the actions that had been taken by the DPRK during 2009, which had been in clear violation of relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions. The missile launches and nuclear weapon test that country had carried out undermined mutual trust, security and stability in the region and beyond. His country was particularly concerned by the DPRKÂs decision to cease all cooperation with the Agency, to the detriment of the application of safeguards in the country. It continued to support the six-party talks aimed at the complete, irreversible and verifiable disablement and dismantlement of the DPRKÂs nuclear weapons programme and related installations in the DPRK, and it encouraged the DPRK to return immediately to the negotiations. 
28. His country highly valued the establishment, wherever feasible, of nuclear-weapon-free zones and zones free of weapons of mass destruction. It particularly supported the establishment of an effectively verifiable zone free of such weapons, and their means of delivery, in the Middle East, and it encouraged all efforts aimed at developing a common regional understanding to that end, with the participation of all parties concerned. 
29. Nuclear terrorism had recently emerged as a new challenge to be taken into account in nonÂ­proliferation efforts. Turkey strongly supported all appropriate measures aimed at preventing terrorists from gaining access to nuclear material and other components of nuclear weapons. It was committed to international efforts to combat terrorism in all its forms, including malicious acts involving nuclear and radioactive material. It therefore supported cooperation between the Agency and the Security Council pursuant to Security Council resolution 1540 (2004) and the AgencyÂs engagement with Member States to address the issue of illicit nuclear trafficking. It encouraged other Member States to join the AgencyÂs illicit trafficking database. 
30. Turkey remained resolutely committed to ensuring the safe, secure and peaceful use of nuclear science and technology. It supported the AgencyÂs efforts to promote and maintain a high level nuclear safety worldwide and encouraged the Secretariat to continue to strengthen its efforts in relation to nuclear, radiation, transport and waste safety in regions where the need for improvement was greatest. It welcomed the revised IAEA Safety Standards Series as the main reference for Member States in drafting or reviewing their national nuclear safety regulations. Its support for the work of the four safety committees would continue, through sharing of expertise and best practice. 
31. The Director General had informed the Board of Governors that the AgencyÂs projections for nuclear power generating capacity in the medium term had been revised upwards. Turkey was aware that the number of Member States considering or already launching new nuclear power programmes was growing, with a corresponding rise in demand for Agency assistance. He expressed his countryÂs 
appreciation to the Agency for its important role in providing guidance to Member States on launching a nuclear power programme for the first time, and for its readiness to support infrastructure development for nuclear power. 
32. With its rapidly expanding economy, TurkeyÂs heavy dependence on fossil fuel resources from external suppliers posed a great challenge to its energy security. According to recent estimates, its growing energy demand would require an additional 100 000 MW(e) of installed electricity generating capacity by 2030. Turkey was looking into possible ways of diversifying its energy resources, in terms of both type and origin, in order to meet that demand. 
33. Currently, there were no nuclear power plants in operation, under construction or decommissioned in Turkey, but the country considered the integration of nuclear energy into its supply package as a viable option to meet its energy requirements in the medium to long term. Preparations were about to be finalized for the construction of a nuclear power plant with a capacity of 5000 MW(e) by 2020. In addition, detailed site investigations were under way for a second site for a plant with a capacity of 10 000 MW(e). 
34. Turkey was following closely the ongoing debate on multilateral approaches to assurances of nuclear fuel supply. The proposed arrangements raised several issues with regard to their technical, political, legal and economic implications that needed to be discussed extensively. His country was prepared to consider non-discriminatory approaches that would ensure uninterrupted supply in a manner that did not impair the current fuel market, based on objective criteria and without prejudice to the legitimate rights of States to develop their own peaceful nuclear capabilities under the NPT. From TurkeyÂs perspective, such mechanisms should fully convince States that they would be able to obtain nuclear fuel in a predictable, stable and cost-effective manner over a long period without undue interference. 
35. For the majority of Member States without nuclear power reactors, technical cooperation in the application of nuclear techniques in agriculture, human health, industry, environment, hydrology, or biological and physical research was a prime benefit of Agency membership. The AgencyÂs work in helping developing countries with nuclear applications was important not only with respect to the direct contribution it made to human well-being; it also helped build broad support for the Agency and its larger responsibilities in relation to nuclear power, safety, security and non-proliferation. 
36. He reiterated his countryÂs strong support for the AgencyÂs technical cooperation programme, as demonstrated by its consistent payment of its contributions to the TCF on time and in full. In addition to its regular payments to the TCF, Turkey would also be bearing the full costs of implementing its national projects during the current technical cooperation cycle. 
37. Mr PARVEZ (Pakistan) said that the AgencyÂs unique role as the worldÂs focal point for promoting peaceful uses of nuclear energy was assuming greater significance in view of the increasing global energy demand, the scarcity of fossil fuel reserves, and environmental concerns. There had been a resurgence of interest in nuclear power following more than twenty years of good and safe performance of nuclear power plants. The Agency had a guiding role to play in promoting equitable access to nuclear technology, material and equipment. 
38. To ensure that every State could realize its right to the peaceful applications of nuclear technology, particularly nuclear power generation, there was a need to develop universal and nonÂ­discriminatory criteria for international cooperation. In that process, principles should be placed above perceptions. The AgencyÂs Statute was based on the concept that the application of safeguards and safety measures was an associated function in promoting and transferring nuclear technology for peaceful purposes. A balance therefore should be maintained between the AgencyÂs promotional activities and its work on verification and nuclear security. In recent times, verification and nuclear 
security had taken up much of the attention of the Agency and its policy-making organs. Efforts should be made to ensure that such a trend did not hamper the AgencyÂs core statutory function of promoting the peaceful uses of nuclear energy, particularly at a time when many developing countries were interested in developing nuclear power programmes and were looking to the Agency in that connection. 
39. The technical cooperation programme was the primary vehicle through which the Agency fulfilled its promotional role and had brought tangible benefits to developing Member States. Pakistan, for its part, had benefited greatly from Agency technical cooperation, not only in the area of nuclear power, but also in such fields as agriculture, hydrology, medicine and industry. It highly appreciated the AgencyÂs efforts to improve the quality of technical cooperation activities, making them compatible with the changing needs and requirements of Member States, despite resource constraints. Technical cooperation activities should be further strengthened by the provision of sufficient resources. Pakistan would continue to contribute to the programme by sharing its experience, offering training placements, and providing the services of experts. 
40. His country had long been a strong advocate of using nuclear technology for progress and prosperity. It had been one of the first developing countries to consider using nuclear energy and its first nuclear power plant, which had been connected to the grid in 1972, was still operating, and all the front-end requirements of the fuel cycle were taken care of within the country. He thanked the Agency for its support in assessing the design and operational safety of his countryÂs second nuclear power plant which had been commissioned in 2000 with Chinese assistance. PakistanÂs third plant was nearing completion and the country looked to the Agency and the developed world for assistance as it developed its nuclear power programme, so that that clean source of electricity could be exploited in his energy-starved country. 
41. His country had also developed programmes on the application of ionizing radiation and radioisotopes in the areas of agriculture and medicine. There were now 13 nuclear medicine centres across the country providing diagnostic and therapeutic services to some half a million people each year. A further five centres were under construction. 
42. Since the inception of its atomic energy development programme, Pakistan had recognized the importance of ensuring safety and security. His country had always striven to follow existing international standards and practices and had based its national regulations on the AgencyÂs safety standards. Agency guidance documents on the physical protection of facilities and material, and on the safety and security of radioactive sources, were used as a basis for inspection and enforcement. 
43. Pakistan had been fulfilling its obligations under the Convention on Nuclear Safety, the CPPNM, and the Early Notification and Assistance Conventions. It also participated actively in the AgencyÂs nuclear safety and security programmes and contributed to the AgencyÂs illicit trafficking database, INES and the IRS. 
44. His country was committed to nuclear non-proliferation and had maintained a good track record with regard to safeguards. It was continuously improving controls over the export of goods, technologies and facilities and believed that the global non-proliferation regime had to be strengthened on the basis of moral, political and international commitments. 
45. In conclusion, his country expressed appreciation for the valuable assistance provided by the Agency in the areas of nuclear technology, safety and security. It urged the Agency to facilitate the construction of nuclear power plants in Member States on a non-discriminatory basis with a view to promoting economic growth for all. 
46. Mr OTHMAN (Syrian Arab Republic) thanked the Member States that had expressed support and understanding for SyriaÂs position. However, the comments of some States regarding the Israeli attack on SyriaÂs territorial sovereignty in September 2007 and the destruction of a military installation that was under construction and that had no connection with nuclear activities were regrettable. IsraelÂs conduct had flouted international law. In spite of SyriaÂs indignation at the international communityÂs failure to take any serious practical steps to question Israel and to take legal action against it pursuant to the Charter of the United Nations and relevant resolutions, it had met all the AgencyÂs demands, allowing a team to visit the site of the destroyed building, to move around freely and to take environmental samples from the site and the surrounding area. Syria had also provided the Agency with information and replies to all its questions. It would continue to cooperate with it on all matters pertaining to its obligations under the Statute and its safeguards agreement. However, the fact that Syria was still being asked for information and documentation, while its attacker was never questioned, encouraged the latter to mount further attacks. 
47. Syria deplored the manner in which the agenda item on application of Agency safeguards in the Middle East had been dealt with at the preceding session of the General Conference. The adoption of amendments proposed by the delegation of Israel, the only State in the region that had not acceded to the NPT, and the rejection of amendments proposed by the Arab States, undermined the spirit of consensus and sent a negative message to the peoples of the Middle East regarding the continuing application of double standards within the United Nations. 
48. Israel had recently waged a savage war against the defenceless women and children of Gaza, using internationally prohibited weapons and had paid no heed to international appeals to halt the hostilities. Its war has caused panic, permanent disabilities, severe mental trauma, destruction and displacement, and it had flouted all international treaties concerning military acts against civilians. Such conduct underscored the urgent need to rid the Middle East of nuclear weapons. He reminded the international community of the resolutions calling for a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East and of SyriaÂs serious attempt to achieve that aim when, as a member of the United Nations Security Council in 2003, it had submitted a draft resolution on behalf of the Arab States concerning the establishment of such a zone. However, it had failed to secure the approval of the States that supported Israel. 
49. IsraelÂs obstruction of attempts to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East were based on the argument that peace should first be achieved. That approach simply demonstrated that Israel lacked the political will to make peace and was determined to maintain its military hegemony in the region. A succession of Israeli governments had failed to take any positive steps in response to international peace initiatives. Instead they pressed ahead with their aggressive policy of occupation of Arab lands, settlement-building and the Judaization of Jerusalem. 
50. The Pelindaba Treaty and the Treaty on a Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone in Central Asia had both entered into force in 2009. Thus, the Southern Hemisphere was now a nuclear-weapon-free zone, thereby strengthening the NPT regime. The major powers bore a special responsibility to redouble their efforts to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East, otherwise the efforts made in Africa would lack credibility. 
51. The group of Arab States had proposed an agenda item on Israeli nuclear capabilities at every session of the General Conference for a number of years and was seeking to draw attention at all major international events to the danger to regional and international peace, security and stability posed by IsraelÂs possession of nuclear weapons. The unwillingness of some Member States to discuss the matter encouraged Israel to continue to develop its nuclear arsenal without any form of international oversight. His country called on the international community to give the agenda item the attention it deserved, and to bring pressure to bear on Israel to accede to the NPT and place all its nuclear 
installations under Agency safeguards as a first step towards establishing a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East. 
52. The Agency had faced major difficulties in adopting its programme and budget for the year ahead owing to the SecretariatÂs proposal for a substantial increase. The agreement of the policy-making organs to a departure from zero real growth in the Regular Budget, to meet the costs of Major Programme 3 in particular, called for a process of reflection on priorities and on the extent to which they corresponded to the three pillars of the AgencyÂs Statute. He urged the Secretariat to pursue a policy of rationalization when dealing with matters that did not form part of the AgencyÂs core mandate and to give the requisite attention to matters that were directly related to the technical cooperation programme. 
53. The process of preparing a strategy document containing a vision for the AgencyÂs future had proved difficult for a number of reasons, chief among them the divergence of opinion regarding the AgencyÂs priorities, the tremendous pressure on the Agency to finance programmes that were not directly related to its mandate, the limited resources available under the Regular Budget and the challenges posed by the current global economic crisis. Member States bore a responsibility to future generations to guarantee a bright future for the Agency, based on the three pillars of its Statute. One of their foremost responsibilities was the development of appropriate financing arrangements that would enable to Agency to fulfil its mandate in a balanced manner. 
54. The developing countries faced many obstacles when it came to implementing their national technical cooperation programmes. It was essential to ensure the successful implementation of the AgencyÂs technical cooperation programme, and that countries possessing the requisite technology provided the organization with the facilities it needed. A political prohibition on the export of scientific equipment for strictly humanitarian purposes prevented peoples from exercising their right under the Charter of the United Nations to benefit from scientific and technological development. 
55. Syria continued to support the technical cooperation programme at regional and national level. In early 2009, it had hosted the regional meeting of the ARASIA Board of Representatives. That meeting had issued recommendations aimed at implementing regional projects under Agency oversight. He thanked the Secretariat staff who had helped to ensure their successful implementation. 
56. Syria commended the Agency on its organization of seminars, workshops and technical meetings in 2008, the circulation of questionnaires, and the publications issued in the Nuclear Energy Series which offered helpful guidance to countries that were considering the nuclear energy option. The projects under the technical cooperation programme in that area afforded further evidence of the need for giving the same attention to that programme as to the rest of the AgencyÂs programmes. 
57. After a careful study of energy demand and availability, the Atomic Energy Commission of Syria and the Ministry for Electricity had launched a project in cooperation with the Agency on nuclear electricity generation. During the 2008Â2009 biennium, Syria had opened a nuclear engineering branch at Damascus University. For the preceding ten years, the Agency had supported the advanced studies programme on radiation protection and the safety of radioactive sources run jointly by the Agency, the Atomic Energy Commission and Damascus University. Over that period, more than 200 students from a number of Arab countries had graduated. He warmly thanked the AgencyÂs Secretariat and encouraged the Arab States to send their students to attend the course. In early 2010, a 33-week regional course in Arabic would begin in Damascus. 
58. Mr TOUKAN (Jordan) said that, in view of JordanÂs limited energy sources, nuclear energy was now perceived as the best available option to meet the countryÂs future demand for electricity. Jordan currently relied on oil derivatives and the sharp increase in import costs had led to a trade deficit. As nuclear power was a stable source of energy and environmentally friendly, especially from the point of 
view of climate change, it had become JordanÂs strategic energy option for the future. It was also the most effective means of achieving the goal of building a strong economy based on a stable supply of energy and water. 
59. JordanÂs natural sources of uranium were a key component of the countryÂs nuclear programme, enabling it become self-reliant in the area of power generation. There were also plans to build nuclear reactors to meet the countryÂs demand for electricity and for low-cost energy for seawater desalination. The Jordan Atomic Energy Commission was drawing up plans for the exploitation of the countryÂs uranium and had signed agreements with three international prospecting companies. It had also begun to build partnerships with international companies with a view to conducting geological, physical and chemical studies. Other studies focused on the building of nuclear reactors that complied with international nuclear safety and security standards, and a preparatory programme for the training of Jordanian human resources in nuclear science and technology had been launched. The Jordan University of Science and Technology now offered a nuclear engineering course, and preparations had begun for the building of a nuclear research and training reactor at the university. 
60. Jordan had signed nuclear cooperation agreements with a number of countries with advanced nuclear energy programmes, such as France, Canada, China, the Republic of Korea, the Russian Federation and the United Kingdom, with a view to benefiting from their expertise. It would sign additional agreements before the end of 2009 with Argentina and Spain, and negotiations were under way with other countries, including Japan and the United States. 
61. Jordan had benefited from a number of national, regional and interregional projects under the AgencyÂs technical cooperation programme, in particular a project on uranium extraction under which the Agency had provided a facility for recovering yellowcake from phosphoric acid. Steps had been taken to implement two further projects, one on uranium extraction and the other on uranium exploration. Other important activities related to a technical and economic feasibility study for a nuclear power and water desalination plant, and the synchrotron project (SESAME). 
62. Jordan greatly appreciated the AgencyÂs technical support, in particular the recent INIR mission to the country. It had also recently completed its CPF. 
63. He urged the Agency to give special attention to the needs of countries that were contemplating the use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes and were seeking to boost regional cooperation in order to take advantage of opportunities for investment in infrastructure pertaining to nuclear energy projects, nuclear safety and security requirements, and human resources development. 
64. Jordan welcomed the proposals by Member States and the Director General concerning assurances of nuclear fuel supply. It drew attention to the need for an in-depth study of the legal aspects and implications of the proposals, and their political and technical dimensions. Nuclear fuel assurances should form part of an integrated programme to assist developing countries in building a sustainable civilian nuclear programme. Jordan was determined to broaden its range of options to include the purchase of nuclear fuel services in international markets, without undermining its right to develop research, production and use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes under Article IV of the NPT. It urged all parties to that Treaty to facilitate exchange of materials, equipment and scientific and technological information relating to peaceful applications of nuclear energy. 
65. His country attached great importance to the safeguards regime, which played a major role in promoting nuclear disarmament and guaranteeing non-proliferation of nuclear weapons. Thus it had signed a safeguards agreement and an additional protocol. It was very much aware of the danger posed by weapons of mass destruction to international peace and security and, in particular, to stability in the Middle East, which was still suffering from the consequences of the failure to implement resolutions concerning nuclear disarmament. Jordan emphasized the need for Israel to accede to the NPT and to 
place all its nuclear facilities under Agency safeguards, which would bring about universal adherence to the NPT in the region and lay the basis for the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone. Such action would encourage the countries of the region to focus on economic and social development instead of engaging in an arms race. In that context, he welcomed the substantive discussions under way concerning proposals to turn the Middle East into a zone free of weapons of mass destruction. 
66. Mr JAFFEER (Sri Lanka) said that his country attached great importance to the mandate and functions of the Agency relating to the peaceful use and application of nuclear energy and technology for economic and social development, and it continued to meet fully its obligations and responsibilities vis-Ã -vis the organization. 
67. Throughout the fifty years the Agency had existed, the demand of countries seeking the benefits of the peaceful use and application of nuclear energy had increased, making the organizationÂs role ever more essential. The Agency must remain balanced, impartial and non-political to address those demands, thus ensuring global peace, security and sustainable development. The AgencyÂs success in that regard had been recognized and his country hoped that the prevailing atmosphere would continue to help it carry out its work and mandate effectively. 
68. In recent years, the Agency had been facing new challenges. The depletion of non-renewable energy sources, escalating fossil fuel prices, and the growing challenges of climate change had renewed countriesÂ interest in nuclear energy as a way of meeting the demands of national development and power generation. Hence, the AgencyÂs role had become essential to ensure nuclear safety, security and verification. 
69. Sri Lanka was evaluating the possibility of including nuclear power in its energy mix. It had included a special section on nuclear energy in its CPF for 2009Â2013, which was currently being drafted and would be ready for signature in 2009. 
70. Terrorism remained a great threat to humanity and one that his country had faced for nearly three decades. However, it had been able to overcome that menace and now looked to the future with renewed hope and enthusiasm. It had accelerated rehabilitation and development work in the affected areas and had initiated a political process to address issues via democratic means. 
71. Sri Lanka fully supported global measures to combat terrorism and had been at the forefront of multilateral efforts as Chair of the United Nations Ad Hoc Committee on the elimination of terrorism. It had helped negotiate several texts, resulting in the adoption of three treaties: the International Convention for the Suppression of Terrorist Bombings, the International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism and the International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism. 
72. The world faced the grave threat of nuclear weapons and radioactive material falling into the hands of terrorists. It was therefore vital that countries remain vigilant and ensure that nuclear material and sources were kept safe, secure and accounted for. 
73. Recent concerns had compelled Sri Lanka to address issues related to nuclear security. In collaboration with the United States-initiated Megaports Initiative, it had been able to improve the safety and security of radioactive sources and monitor international movement of nuclear material through ports in Sri Lanka. 
74. General and complete disarmament had been a declared objective of the United Nations and the international community for many decades but had remained elusive. As one of the founding members of the Non-Aligned Movement and an original signatory of the NPT, Sri Lanka had always held that nuclear disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation were interlinked and could not be pursued independently and in isolation. However, obligations and commitments undertaken by countries 
should not jeopardize their sovereign and inalienable right to develop, research, produce and use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes, as enshrined in the relevant provisions of the NPT. 
75. His country welcomed the recent renewed calls by leaders to address the obligations of the nuclear-weapon States to pursue disarmament as well as non-proliferation. It hoped that that conducive atmosphere would bring renewed vigour and dedication to the issue. 
76. Over the preceding five decades, the use of nuclear applications to address challenges that developing nations faced, such as disease, hunger and shortage of drinking water, had increased. Sri Lanka attached high priority to the development of nuclear technology and its potential to contribute to socio-economic improvement in developing countries. 
77. The Agency had played an indispensable role in the field of nuclear applications. Sri Lanka strongly endorsed the views of the Group of 77 and China on further strengthening of the technical cooperation activities of the Agency. Those vital aspects of the AgencyÂs mandate should not be overlooked or weakened. 
78. Agency technical cooperation had enabled Sri Lanka to build capacity in areas such as industry, agriculture, human health, nutrition and radiation protection. Over the preceding few years, the country had obtained technical assistance for such important activities as the use of radioisotope-based molecular techniques for the diagnosis and monitoring of major infectious diseases, including drugÂ­resistant malaria and tuberculosis. Those projects had achieved positive results and had been beneficial for the countryÂs development. There was a demand for support in the area of radiation therapy, diagnosis, medical physics and nutrition, and the necessary funding should be assured to facilitate technical cooperation activities in those areas. 
79. The Agency also provided assistance in the field of agriculture, such as with the development of high-yield varieties of legumes and seeds, and drought-tolerant and high-yield varieties of spices, and in the use of radioisotope techniques in animal husbandry. 
80. Ensuring food and nutrition security had emerged as one of Sri LankaÂs priority requirements in improving the living standards of its people. Agency assistance in that sector closely complemented government initiatives and, under the GovernmentÂs new food initiative, Sri Lanka had even been able to withstand the severe impact of the recent food crisis. 
81. Sri Lanka had been an active member of the RCA since 1976. Under the RCA programme, it had recognized the importance of non-destructive testing techniques for enhancing safety and productivity in industry. The Department of National Planning of Sri Lanka had recommended the establishment of a national centre for non-destructive testing. The country had developed NDT inspection and training capability with the support of the Agency and the proposed centre would perform such work on an enhanced scale. Sri Lanka intended to seek Agency support in that regard in the form of training, equipment and expert services. 
82. His country was concerned at the findings of the WHO regarding the increasing incidence of cancer in developing countries and the threat that it posed to their socio-economic development. In that connection, it commended the AgencyÂs PACT programme, which was a clear demonstration of the peaceful use of the atom. Sri Lanka was privileged to host one of the six PACT Model Demonstration Sites. The PACT programme complemented Sri LankaÂs health policies on the prevention, control and management of malignant diseases. 
83. Sri Lanka had taken part in the International Ministerial Conference on Nuclear Energy in the 21st Century organized by the Agency in China in April 2009. He thanked the Government of the PeopleÂs Republic of China for hosting the conference, which had addressed several issues related to 
fuel prices, concerns about harmful emissions, climate challenges, energy demand and nuclear energy for power generation. 
84. Finally, his country had cooperated with the Agency on a project on human resources development for nuclear technology support which had promoted national development in the field of nuclear technology and had provided assistance in developing human resources in national institutions. It looked forward to continued cooperation with the Agency in similar projects. 
85. Mr COGAN (Ireland) expressed appreciation for the vital role the Agency played in promoting safe, secure and peaceful nuclear technology. For some years his country had been a member of the drafting group which worked on resolutions related to transport of nuclear material and the security and safety of nuclear power. 
86. The AgencyÂs mission was as important today as when it was established. His country welcomed the ongoing debate on the future of the Agency which had begun with the publication of the report of the Commission of Eminent Persons on the role of the Agency up to 2020 and beyond. 
87. His country believed that safety standards and practices were best supported by international peer review and the sharing of knowledge, and that the multilateral disarmament and non-proliferation regime provided the best guarantee of international peace and security. It was committed to maintaining the integrity and inviolability of the relevant treaties and agreements. 
88. The threat posed by nuclear weapons had changed considerably since the adoption of the NPT. Ireland, with the New Agenda Coalition and other partners, had consistently called for prioritization of nuclear disarmament and saw the 13 practical steps agreed upon by the 2000 NPT Review Conference as the benchmark for progress. 
89. He welcomed the commitment by the President of the United States to work for a nuclear-weapon-free world and a stronger NPT, and to work towards ratification of the CTBT by the United States. He likewise welcomed the commitment by the United States and the Russian Federation to negotiate an instrument to replace the START treaties. The nuclear-weapon States should ensure increased transparency in their nuclear activities. Maintaining their current levels of weapons, or developing new ones on the pretext of increasing their national security, set a bad example for other countries. 
90. The NPT provided an essential basis of mutual confidence for the international development of exclusively peaceful uses of nuclear energy and he called upon all those who had not yet signed or ratified the Treaty to do so. The NPT incorporated key rights and obligations which must be recognized by all State Parties. His country looked forward to the 2010 NPT Review Conference, which it hoped would result in a new package of agreements, supported by specific and ambitious benchmarks of progress towards a world free of nuclear weapons. 
91. Ireland believed that a comprehensive safeguards agreement together with an additional protocol was the only acceptable verification standard and was essential to ensure full confidence in the peaceful purpose of a countryÂs nuclear programme. Anything less than the agreed Agency standards fell short and was unacceptable. 
92. The nuclear test carried out by the DPRK in May 2009 showed that countryÂs blatant disregard for the safety of its own citizens and of neighbouring countries. He called upon the DPRK to return to the six-party talks immediately and without preconditions, and to abandon and dismantle any nuclear-weapons-related programme completely, transparently and irreversibly. The DPRK must comply unconditionally and without delay with all its international obligations, as set out in the relevant resolutions of the United Nations Security Council and in the countryÂs comprehensive safeguards agreement. 
93. As the Director General had recently reported to the Board of Governors, Iran had cooperated with the Agency in some areas, but it had not suspended enrichment-related activities or its work on heavy-water projects, nor had it implemented the additional protocol. It must cooperate with the Agency in order to allow the latter to exclude any possibility of there being a military dimension to the countryÂs nuclear programme, and it should implement the additional protocol without delay. 
94. His own country had a policy of not using nuclear energy for electricity generation and remained unconvinced of the case for nuclear power put forward by its advocates. It believed that the risks to human health and the environment from the use of nuclear energy outweighed the potential benefits, but it did not seek to prevent others from harnessing that energy source. Many problems had not yet been resolved, such as the safety and security of nuclear installations, transport of nuclear material, interim and long-term waste management, unnecessary reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel, contamination of the marine and terrestrial environment and the risk of accidents and proliferation. Thus, his country did not see the creation of a new generation of nuclear installations as a solution to the problem of climate change; instead, more international resources should be devoted to the development of renewable energy sources. 
95. Despite its views on nuclear power, Ireland greatly valued its membership of the Agency, and the latterÂs work in the areas of safety and security, and safeguards and verification. His country believed in a multilateral approach to safety and security and it was glad to be able to contribute to the culture of learning and continuous improvement fostered by organizations like the Agency. 
96. Because of the transboundary nature of the risks from a nuclear accident or transport of radioactive material, safety was a matter of concern for nuclear and non-nuclear States alike. Ireland was situated in close proximity to nuclear facilities in neighbouring States over which it had no control. Thus, it was pleased to be part of the global dialogue on nuclear issues, and it placed great emphasis on safety standards, environmental protection, multilateral cooperation and transparency. It welcomed the ongoing debate on nuclear safety and security and was reassured by the level of commitment to those issues displayed by nuclear energy-producing countries. 
97. His country respected and valued the work of the Agency in providing the vital framework for cooperative efforts to build and strengthen the international nuclear safety and security regimes. That framework included advisory standards, codes, guides and binding international conventions, peer reviews and an international emergency preparedness and response system. 
98. His country appreciated the AgencyÂs research in the reprocessing field. Reprocessing gave rise to substantial safety and environmental concerns. Ireland was particularly concerned over the radioactive discharges into the marine environment from a reprocessing plant in a nearby State. It looked forward to working with the Agency to ensure that such activities were undertaken cleanly and without risk. 
99. Ireland had welcomed the adoption in June 2009 of a European Union nuclear safety directive aimed at ensuring the highest standards of safety in the operation of European nuclear facilities. It supported a strong regime for regular, independent safety assessments at nuclear installations and would continue to work for stricter regulation and standards in Europe and throughout the world. 
100. Turning to the transport of nuclear material, he said that Ireland believed that coastal States should be fully informed when shipments passed near their coasts, so that they could carry out a risk assessment and prepare appropriate emergency response measures. His country used the forum provided by the Agency to promote discussion of that issue and engage in meetings between shipping and coastal States. 
101. As nuclear technology continued to spread beyond its traditional use in energy generation, the roles of the Agency, and the complexity of the challenges facing it, would continue to increase. Ireland valued and supported the AgencyÂs pioneering work and its high-quality research in such areas as agriculture, food, human health and other nuclear applications. The TCF was particularly important for upgrading safety standards in beneficiary States. 
102. His country welcomed the progress made under the Nuclear Security Plan 2006Â2009, and the approval by the Board of Governors of the next plan covering the period 2010Â2013. It welcomed especially the attention the Agency would be giving to providing assistance to States planning to include nuclear power in their energy mix for the first time. In his countryÂs view, that activity reflected the AgencyÂs greatest strength: sharing of knowledge and experience and nurturing of a culture of constant improvement through peer review. 
103. The world had changed considerably since the AgencyÂs founding and new challenges, such as advances in technology in energy production and elsewhere, and the wider application of nuclear technology in the industrial, health-care and agricultural sectors, made a review of its roles and objectives both timely and necessary. The review should be used to strengthen and amend existing structures in order to achieve more effective and efficient operation. He thanked Ambassador Kauppi of Finland and her successor, Ambassador Vallim Guerreiro of Brazil, for chairing that process. 
104. Mr CURIA (Argentina) said that, over the preceding year, his country had continued to reactivate its nuclear activities, re-establishing a nuclear programme based around large-scale nuclear power generation, with a heavy emphasis on developing autonomous capacity in the supply of nuclear products and services, and around nuclear technology applications in public health and industry. 
105. Work to complete the Atucha II nuclear power plant was ongoing and the plant was expected to be connected to the national grid in mid-2011. The preliminary studies and activities relating to the life extension of the Embalse nuclear power plant and the assessments relating to the construction of new nuclear power plants in the coming decade were also ongoing, and activities relating to the construction of the prototype innovative CAREM reactor had been stepped up and it was expected that project would be complete within five years. 
106. Argentina continued to participate actively in international efforts to develop next-generation reactors and fuel cycles that offered a higher level of operational safety, substantially reduced radioactive waste generation and eliminated proliferation risks. In particular, it supported INPRO through the provision of experts and extrabudgetary funding. 
107. Measures had been taken to strengthen nuclear fuel cycle activities and efforts were continuing with a view to resuming uranium enrichment activities at the Pilcaniyeu Technological Complex. The aim was to meet future demand for LEU for fuel elements for heavy-water moderated natural uranium power reactors, and to meet the demand for low-enriched fuel for national research and production reactors and, possibly, experimental reactors exported to third countries, and, in the medium term, for the CAREM reactor. 
108. Uranium mining and prospecting activities were being intensified, as was environmental rehabilitation of deposits previously used for such mining. The Arroyito plant continued to produce heavy water with a view to completing the initial inventory for the Atucha II plant and supplying plants in operation. 
109. Turning to nuclear technology applications, particularly in the area of human health, he noted that the operation of the nuclear medicine centres linked to the National Atomic Energy Commission had been strengthened, including through the upgrading of equipment and the continuation of research on boron neutron capture therapy. Recalling the acute shortage of radioisotopes for medical use, he 
said that, with its normal production level, Argentina was not only meeting national demand for such radioisotopes but had also provided some to other countries in the region, including molybdenum-99. 
110. The National Atomic Energy Commission had intensified its activities on nuclear power and research reactors, the fuel cycle, spent fuel and radioactive waste management, and nuclear applications, as well as basic scientific research. Efforts were also being made to strengthen the training of highly specialized human resources through the three university-level institutes specializing in nuclear and related disciplines, and associated nuclear medicine centres. 
111. Argentina remained open to cooperation in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy at multilateral level through active participation in the AgencyÂs technical cooperation programme and ARCAL, and at bilateral level through specific cooperation agreements with more than 30 countries. ARCAL was celebrating its twenty-fifth anniversary. The Agreement constituted an important vehicle for cooperation in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy among the countries of Latin America and the Caribbean. 
112. His country attached particular importance to the AgencyÂs nuclear, radiation, transport and waste safety activities and international cooperation in that field. The existence of solid, effective and sustainable infrastructures was crucial for the expansion of nuclear energy, and its safe and efficient use. Training in those areas was also important. His country had always been active in that area and had signed a long-term agreement with the Agency to become a regional training centre. It welcomed the efforts of the Agency to conclude similar agreements with other countries. 
113. Argentina appreciated the activities of the Ibero-American Forum of Radiological and Nuclear Regulatory Agencies and stressed that technical projects undertaken by the Forum should be coordinated closely with Agency programmes. The 12th International Congress of the International Radiation Protection Association had been held in Buenos Aires in October 2008 and had led to the establishment of standards for protection against the harmful effects of radiation exposure with a view to strengthening radiation protection across the five continents. He thanked the Secretariat for its support which had ensured broad participation by developing countries. 
114. Nuclear security and nuclear safety were issues that must be tackled together not separately, and careful consideration should be given to how the Secretariat dealt with the synergy between safety and security and with the risks of potential acts of nuclear terrorism. 
115. International safeguards, together with nuclear and radiation safety, were especially important for facilitating nuclear expansion. The Agency implemented an effective verification system to assure the international community of the peaceful nature of nuclear programmes. Safeguards had to be implemented in a spirit of cooperation and dialogue between the Agency and Member States, guided by the principles of non-discrimination, quality, technical excellence and objectivity. He highlighted the valuable contribution ABACC had made to non-proliferation efforts for over 18 years. His country valued highly the cooperation between the Agency and ABACC, which should be extended and intensified. 
116. Turning to nuclear accounting and control in Argentina, he noted that the Nuclear Regulatory Authority was continuing its work. The existence of such an independent body demonstrated his GovernmentÂs conviction that appropriate accounting was essential for safe and efficient implementation of nuclear activities and public acceptance. The Nuclear Regulatory Authority continued to give priority to tasks related to the licensing of Atucha II and the CAREM reactor, and the life extension of the Embalse and Atucha I plants. 
117. Mr EL-KHOURY (Lebanon) said that the Agency faced complex challenges in a world that was evolving at great speed. Scientific and technological advances, which should be associated with 
equality of opportunity, transparency and morality, also involved political, economic and environmental risks, of which poor and developing societies, who accounted for the majority of the worldÂs inhabitants, were generally the main victims. His country therefore supported the idea of involving all Member States in a dialogue with each other and with the Secretariat with a view to enhancing the AgencyÂs performance. The main challenge would consist in translating the outcome of that dialogue into practical proposals on which all could agree, since views still differed sharply on such basic issues as safeguards, technical cooperation and nuclear security. 
118. Lebanon attached special importance to the use of nuclear energy in such fields as agriculture, medicine and the environment in support of sustainable development. It reaffirmed StatesÂ inalienable right to the peaceful use of nuclear energy, which should not be inhibited for political motives, or rendered ineffectual by an imbalance within the Agency between the various components of the organizationÂs mandate. Lebanon was therefore paying close attention to the fuel assurance initiatives that were currently being discussed, and to the Director GeneralÂs efforts in that connection. It would support any arrangement that secured a consensus, unless it placed an additional financial burden on the Agency or was used by a few advanced countries to monopolize expertise regarding the nuclear fuel cycle and to prevent transfer of fuel cycle expertise to developing countries. The Director GeneralÂs initiative and the other proposals laid the basis for an eventual meeting of minds on effective guarantees that would allay the doubts and fears of some developing countries. 
119. Lebanon was committed to full compliance with the AgencyÂs nuclear safety guidelines and was taking steps to ratify the Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management. Technical cooperation between the Agency and Lebanon on nuclear security was proceeding satisfactorily and was highly appreciated. 
120. His country, like many others, was keen to explore the possibility of using nuclear energy for electricity generation. It urgently needed to address mounting problems and increased demand by developing appropriate infrastructure and legislation that was in line with the standards applied by the Agency. It would shortly be in a position to submit proposals to the Agency and friendly States requesting technical, scientific and material support. 
121. Lebanon, which attached great importance to its partnership with the Agency and hoped to make full use of its programmes and expertise, had paid all its financial contributions and arrears. 
122. He commended the AgencyÂs activities in the area of safeguards and welcomed the use of extrabudgetary funds to modernize the AgencyÂs laboratories. When undertaking verification work, the Secretariat should remain within the bounds of the Statute, maintaining a careful balance between the obligations imposed by comprehensive safeguards agreements and the standards of transparency, objectivity and impartiality observed by the parties thereto. 
123. The significant increase in the AgencyÂs latest budget proposal had impeded its smooth adoption. Any growth in the AgencyÂs work should be natural and indispensable, and aim at meeting fresh demands for its expertise and services. It should not place an excessive burden on developing countries or adversely affect the technical cooperation programme. That would not be a difficult result to achieve if Member States put their minds to it and were determined to succeed. 
124. The issue of Israeli nuclear capabilities was raised at every session of the General Conference. In reality, it was an easy problem to solve if States adopted an unbiased and strictly technical approach. All that the Arab States were demanding was that Israel accede to the NPT and place its nuclear installations under comprehensive Agency safeguards. Such action was a prerequisite for the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East, a region that continued to suffer from the consequences of Israeli aggression. The world had not forgotten the destructive war waged against Lebanon in the summer of 2006, and that waged against Gaza in early 2009. Israel had left millions of 
cluster bombs on Lebanese soil which continued to claim victims among workers, children and members of the international units that had volunteered to clear them away. 
125. However, one should not lose hope. The international community remained determined to achieve a just and comprehensive peace throughout the world, and particularly in the Middle East, so that all peoples could enjoy prosperity and well-being. The Agency had an essential role to play in that regard. 
126. Mr FERUTÃ  (Romania) said that his countryÂs policy in promoting both power and non-power nuclear applications, and its national objectives within the framework of the technical cooperation programme, were in line with the European UnionÂs objectives in the energy field. Development in the nuclear field continued to be essential to Romania, which considered investments in secure and sustainable nuclear power capabilities to be a viable option. The contribution of nuclear power to the countryÂs national energy mix was continuously increasing. 
127. The Cernavoda nuclear power plant, which currently provided around 18% of RomaniaÂs electricity, was to be extended with the completion of two new CANDU-6 units by the end of 2016, which were expected to supply 35% of electricity needs, thus reducing dependence on fossil fuels. In November 2008, the State-owned company Nuclearelectrica SA and a group of six important international investors had agreed to set up a project company devoted to the completion, commissioning and operation of those two new units. Romania had decided to extend its national nuclear programme still further and a site selection study for a new nuclear power plant, expected to become operational by 2020, was already under way. 
128. Despite the worldÂs economic and financial crisis, issues related to human health, water resources and the environment continued to be important and his country appreciated the AgencyÂs efforts to apply nuclear science and technology in support of sustainable development in Member States. 
129. Romania had been consistently promoting nuclear applications and techniques in medicine, and centres for early diagnosis and treatment of cancer based on PET were soon to be extended to all regions of the country. 
130. RomaniaÂs main objectives in the area of non-power nuclear applications were: implementation of new image analysis and processing systems for medicine and industry; diversification of nuclear research and development in the field of radioisotopes, irradiation techniques and advanced materials technologies for use in a wide range of fields; and integration of its nuclear research infrastructure into the European Research Area Network. 
131. Since the preceding General Conference, Romania had established a centre for the coordination and supervision of response to nuclear emergencies. 
132. His country had been a party to the NPT since 1970 and was fully committed to its three pillars. The additional protocol to its safeguards agreement had been in force since 2000. 
133. Romania had been an active promoter of the AgencyÂs nuclear safety and security activities and saw international cooperation and adherence to the relevant conventions as crucial to promoting the global nuclear safety network. 
134. His country had demonstrated its commitment to combating nuclear threats through its efforts to repatriate all high-enriched spent fuel stored in Romania to the Russian Federation, an activity that had been completed in June 2009 with the support of the Global Threat Reduction Initiative. The cooperation between his country, the United States of America, the Russian Federation and the Agency had made that operation a success. Romania had thus become the 14th country from which 
high-enriched spent nuclear fuel had been totally removed. The operation had involved the first authorized commercial air shipment of spent nuclear fuel, demonstrating that air shipment was a viable option for spent fuel repatriation. 
135. In the interests of preventing nuclear terrorism, Romania had decided to increase its involvement in the working groups organized under the Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism and the Global Nuclear Energy Partnership. In September 2008, it had signed an agreement with the United States of America to coordinate efforts to prevent nuclear smuggling by installing modern radiation detection equipment at multiple points of entry. The ability to detect illicit shipments of nuclear and other radioactive material and rapidly share information on such events would be a key component in the global efforts to combat nuclear terrorism. 
136. Romania continued to be committed to developing peaceful nuclear technologies through international technical cooperation coordinated by the Agency, and it was also ready to share its own expertise and experience with partners. The medium-term projects under its current CPF focused on nuclear and radiation safety, radioactive waste and spent fuel management, sustainability, human resources and human health. 
137. His country had jointly organized with the Agency several international events related to its CPF priorities, which had provided opportunities for experts to exchange knowledge concerning reactor safety, safety assessment, decommissioning of nuclear facilities, human resources planning and management of the lifetime of nuclear power plants. 
138. Plans for the next technical cooperation cycle should take into account the projected development of nuclear power over the coming years. Romania would continue to place emphasis on regional knowledge-sharing activities. 
139. Romania continued to pay its full financial contribution to the AgencyÂs technical cooperation activities and had already pledged its national voluntary contribution to support the AgencyÂs technical cooperation projects. 
140. His country believed strongly that the Agency had to have the resources it needed to operate independently and implement all its functions and tasks. He had been privileged to work on building a consensus on the 2010Â2011 Agency programme and budget and was convinced that it constituted a step forward in preparing the Agency for its future challenges. The AgencyÂs tasks of facilitating international cooperation on the peaceful uses of nuclear energy and promoting nuclear safety, security and verification were more important than ever. 
141. Mr RIJMENANS (Belgium) said his country remained convinced of the AgencyÂs crucial role in enlarging the contribution of nuclear energy to peace, health and prosperity and in ensuring, in conformity with its Statute, that nuclear activities were not diverted for military purposes. The Agency played an essential role in encouraging and assisting States to put in place the most rigorous nuclear safety criteria and in preventing terrorism. His country maintained that the NPT was and must remain the hub of the non-proliferation regime. International peace and security were currently facing major challenges and an effective multilateral approach was needed to respond to those challenges. 
142. His country called once again on Iran to cooperate fully and transparently with the Agency and to respond as a matter of urgency to the outstanding issues regarding its nuclear programme in order to provide assurances of its exclusively peaceful nature. Iran must meet all its international obligations. In particular, it should implement the additional protocol and suspend its enrichment activities in conformity with the resolutions of the United Nations Security Council and the Board of Governors. Belgium supported the impartial and professional work of the Agency in dealing with that particularly difficult case. It urged Iran to respond positively to the offers of negotiation made by the 5 permanent 
members of the Security Council plus Germany, with the support of the European Union High Representative. 
143. The Belgian Ministry of Foreign Affairs had firmly condemned the nuclear test announced by the DPRK in April. Such provocation did not inspire confidence in the re-establishment of security and stability in the region. His country called on the DPRK to return to the six-party talks, reassume its responsibilities under the NPT, implement the decisions of the Security Council, dismantle its nuclear installations in a verifiable and irreversible manner and abandon its weapons-grade nuclear material. The Agency should play its full role in the verification of the DPRKÂs nuclear file and it was essential that the inspectors return to the country. 
144. Belgium also called on Syria to cooperate fully and transparently with the Agency so that the latter could conduct all the investigations necessary to resolve the questions concerning the presence of undeclared nuclear material in the country. Syria should also ratify the additional protocol to allow its file to be closed swiftly. 
145. The aforementioned cases showed the importance of giving the Agency the instruments it needed to carry out its work. It was essential to reinforce the obligation of States to cooperate with respect to nuclear verification. His country supported universal application of comprehensive safeguards and the additional protocol. Ninety-one countries had an additional protocol in force. The combination of an additional protocol and a comprehensive safeguards agreement had thus become the current verification standard. Belgium also called upon States concerned to sign an SQP and the amendment thereto as soon as possible. 
146. Convinced as it was of the essential role played by the Agency, Belgium made both in-kind and financial contributions to the organization, of both an obligatory and voluntary nature. Technical cooperation was one of the AgencyÂs priorities and his country attached especial importance to it. In the current year, Belgium would be paying a substantial contribution to the TCF. 
147. The discussions in the Board of Governors on multilateral assurances of nuclear fuel supply were important and he urged Member States to follow them. Belgium was considering what contribution it might make to elaborating such a mechanism. 
148. His country shared the international concern over the problems with the supply of medical radioisotopes and it was playing an active part in addressing that issue. In the short term, it had increased the production capacity of the BR2 reactor, to the extent that technical and organizational limitations permitted, without affecting the safety of the reactor and subject to adequate funding. The Belgian Institute for Radioisotopes had received authorization from the authorities to increase weekly production within the limits set for annual production. With a view to a longer-term solution, Belgium was participating in international initiatives to find a structural solution to the radioisotope supply problem. It was member of the high-level working group of the OECD/NEA on security of supply, in which the Agency also played an important role. It was currently studying the possibility of making a financial contribution to that group and called on the international community to pursue its efforts to find a solution to that urgent problem as quickly as possible. 
149. Nuclear power provided over half of BelgiumÂs electricity and the country was pursuing its consideration of its future energy policy. The committee which had been established to do that was currently preparing its final report which would be submitted to the Council of Ministers that autumn. 
150. In April 2008, after several years of preparation, the Belgian safety authority had been strengthened by establishing a subsidiary organization responsible for a number of tasks, inter alia inspections in plants and safety analyses, which had previously been performed by a private body. The 
know-how of that body had been largely preserved as 90% of its staff had been integrated into the subsidiary organization. 
151. Pursuant to Article 35 of the Euratom Treaty, an inspection had been performed by the European Commission in January 2009 to verify the proper functioning of radioactivity monitoring installations and analysis and interpretation methods, and it had been concluded that Belgium was fulfilling all its obligations in that regard. 
152. In 2006, his country had decided to build a final disposal site for short-lived low-and intermediate-level radioactive waste in the Dessel region. The Belgian Agency for Radioactive Waste and Enriched Fissile Materials (ONDRAF), which was responsible for the management of such waste, intended to submit a licensing request to the safety authority by 2011. The Federal Agency for Nuclear Control (AFCN) was following closely the preparatory work of ONDRAF and establishing specific guidelines based on international best practice and Agency standards. It was also adjusting the existing regulatory framework to adapt the licensing process for that type of installation. 
153. ONDRAF, the AFCN and most federations active in the scrap metal sector had signed a protocol on contaminated scrap metal and radioactive substances at the end of 2007 with the aim of managing and tracing radioactive material outside the nuclear sector. One of the expected benefits of the protocol Â which incorporated a financial incentive for operators Â was a reduction in the number of undeclared or lost orphan sources. That mechanism would be evaluated after 3 years. 
154. With regard to nuclear security, on 17 July 2009 the Council of Ministers had approved the draft regulations on the physical protection of nuclear material. The regulatory texts were currently with the Council of State and would then be sent to parliament. The future regulations were based directly on INFCIRC/225 and took account of the amendment to the CPPNM. Monitoring of the reliability of persons with access to nuclear material and installations and related documents was given major attention, as well as a graduated approach and defence in depth at sites where nuclear material was located. 
155. The law accepting the International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism had been adopted by parliament on 25 June 2009 and was awaiting royal approval. 
156. Regulatory work was continuing on the safety of radioactive sources, based on the Code of Conduct on the Safety and Security of Radioactive Sources and the Guidance on the Import and Export of Radioactive Sources. The main difficulties encountered related to the extreme diversity of users and their significant numbers. Implementation of those regulations would require a user outreach campaign. With regard to export and import of sources, Belgium was in favour of more structured system for control of exports allowing for refusal. 
157. When elaborating new nuclear regulations, the AgencyÂs recommendations provided very valuable assistance. Thus, Belgium played an active part in several groups responsible for elaborating various parts of the Nuclear Security Series. It welcomed the progress made, though the task was far from finished, and felt sure the process would be crowned with success. However, attention should be given to strict respect for the principle of a graduated approach in selecting the recommended measures, and due account should be taken of the specific characteristics of fissile material and other radioactive material. 
158. The Belgian competent authority had approved the draft safeguards agreement for Belgium elaborated by the Agency in collaboration with the European Commission. His country hope that integrated safeguards could be applied in the near future throughout the European Union, allowing for a rationalization of inspection activities and consequent substantial savings, without undermining nonÂ­proliferation objectives. 
159. Expressing appreciation for the professionalism of the Director General and the Secretariat, he urged all Member States to work together to achieve their common objectives at a time when the Agency was facing major challenges. 
160. Mr SVEDAS (Lithuania) said that non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction would always be particularly important for international peace and security and his country called upon all States to adhere to and comply with the NPT. The AgencyÂs safeguards system played a central role in curbing the proliferation of nuclear weapons and moving towards nuclear disarmament. Lithuania strongly supported efforts to strengthen the effectiveness and improve the efficiency of that system and called upon all countries to conclude comprehensive safeguards agreements and additional protocols, as the global standard for verifying compliance with the NPT. Lithuania firmly abided by its nuclear non-proliferation commitments, as was confirmed by the Agency and the fact it was one of the 25 Member States where integrated safeguards were being implemented throughout 2008. 
161. Energy issues were very high on his countryÂs political agenda and attracted a lot of public attention. By the end of 2009, the Ignalina nuclear power plant would be shut down and the necessary measures would have to be taken to ensure the safe and smooth decommissioning and dismantling of both its units. A regional project was under way, with the participation of Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia and Poland, to develop the Visaginas nuclear power plant. In addition, power connections were being built with Poland, Sweden and Finland with a view to integrating the Baltic StatesÂ energy market into that of the European Union. 
162. As a country using nuclear energy, Lithuania paid due attention to nuclear safety and security and radioactive waste management. The responsibility for nuclear security rested entirely with the State and an effective national security system was vital in enhancing global efforts to combat nuclear terrorism and in facilitating the peaceful use of nuclear energy. Physical protection issues were properly addressed at the countryÂs existing nuclear facilities, and in the preparatory activities for the construction of new ones. 
163. In April 2009, a national seminar on physical protection issues during the preparatory stage and construction of new nuclear facilities had been held in Lithuania. The Agency had given valuable assistance in providing experts for the event. Cooperation with the Agency on nuclear security had contributed towards defining the design basis threat for the new nuclear power plant to be built in the country. 
164. Lithuania had deposited with the Agency ratification documents for the amendment to the CPPNM in May 2009 and hoped that the amendment would enter into force without delay. 
165. During 2008, more than 70 experts from Lithuania had participated in safety-related workshops, expert meetings, conferences and other events organized in cooperation with, or under the auspices of, the Agency. More than 20 national experts had contributed to the review of Agency safety standards and guides. Further steps were being taken to strengthen the regulatory regime and the national regulatory authority Â the State Nuclear Power Safety Inspectorate (VATESI). A new nuclear safety law was in preparation with the aim of reinforcing and increasing the efficiency of the nuclear safety regulation and supervision system by clearly defining supervision and enforcement measures and enhancing the financing system of the regulatory institution. During preparations for the construction of the new nuclear power plant, all regulatory requirements had been assessed systematically against the AgencyÂs safety standards. A plan for further improvements had been developed, for implementation by 2011. 
166. The target date for the commissioning of the new Visaginas nuclear power plant was 2018. The environmental impact assessment had been completed in close coordination with Lithuanian society and neighbouring countries. The resulting report had been examined by an Agency international expert 
review mission. In April 2009, the Ministry of the Environment had taken a positive decision on the feasibility of constructing the Visaginas plant on the site of the Ignalina nuclear power plant. A business model to integrate all partner countries and a strategic investor would be developed by the end of 2009. 
167. The issue of radioactive waste management was becoming increasingly relevant. Existing nuclear installations and other facilities using radioactive material were ageing and their eventual decommissioning was approaching. The nuclear renaissance made it necessary to supply new and innovative possibilities for the management of radioactive waste, including spent fuel. Confidence in the safety of spent fuel and radioactive waste management was an important factor in the public acceptance of nuclear energy. In that regard, Lithuania recognized the importance of the Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management, which provided an international peer review mechanism. In implementing its national radioactive waste management strategy, Lithuania had significantly improved its radioactive waste management infrastructure. The country was also exploring possible alternative solutions for spent fuel management. It was participating in the European Repository Development Organization initiative with the aim of developing a concept for multinational geological disposal of spent fuel. 
168. His country strove to maintain the highest standards in monitoring activities involving the use of ionizing radiation. Many measures were in place to ensure that the impact of ionizing radiation was justified, optimized and limited to the lowest possible level. 
169. The Code of Conduct on the Safety and Security of Radioactive Sources and the Guidance on the Import and Export of Radioactive Sources were non-binding international instruments. However, serious account had been taken of both in managing high-activity sources in Lithuania and in striving to establish effective control of sources and minimize the associated risks. 
170. With regard to radiation protection in medicine, new diagnostic reference levels had been developed and approved in cooperation with the Agency, and another project on patient protection in computed tomography, especially in paediatrics, had been launched. On account of the importance Lithuania attached to training in that regard, a modern training centre had been established for national and foreign specialists. Efforts were being made to assimilate best international practices and develop appropriate training standards. 
171. The AgencyÂs technical cooperation programme was one of the key mechanisms for achieving a tangible socio-economic impact not only in individual Member States but also in the region. His country attached great importance to support for and strengthening of technical cooperation activities, It participated in government cost-sharing and paid its contribution to the TCF in full and on time. The countryÂs participation in technical cooperation activities was based on its CPF developed in 2001, while its regional cooperation activities were guided by the European regional profile. The technical cooperation strategy for Europe, which was under development, would help the Agency manage national, regional and interregional projects. 
172. In view of recent developments in the nuclear field, Lithuania was concerned at the lack of availability of qualified personnel for the nuclear industry. It appreciated the AgencyÂs continued support for strengthening of capabilities for managing, preserving and transferring nuclear knowledge, and developing new skills and competences in nuclear-related areas. 
173. Ms PHETCHARATANA (Thailand) said that the growing interest in nuclear energy, to which the increasing number of new entrant countries and the expansion of existing nuclear power programmes attested, was both an opportunity and a challenge for the Agency. The Agency would need strong support from all Member States to address in an effective manner challenges associated with the risks of nuclear accidents and terrorism. Thailand, for its part, had undertaken a number of 
measures to complement the AgencyÂs work to promote nuclear safeguards and verification, safety and security, and cooperation in science and technology applications. It hoped to strengthen further its partnership with the Agency, notably in the promotion of energy for development. 
174. The Agency was the sole international nuclear verification body and the world relied on its technical expertise and indispensable role in strengthening the global nuclear non-proliferation regime. Thailand commended the AgencyÂs tireless efforts in implementing effective nuclear verification in several proliferation cases. 
175. Her country supported all efforts aimed at strengthening the effectiveness and efficiency of the safeguards system. Comprehensive safeguards agreements and additional protocols served as the international standard for nuclear verification, and Thailand was taking practical steps to ratify an additional protocol. Her country looked forward to closer cooperation between the Agency and Member States based on goodwill and mutual respect, and to the development of cooperation between Agency inspectors and local experts in Member States, in particular in developing countries, which could enhance the AgencyÂs verification work. Cooperation between the Agency and regional nuclear-weapon-free zones might also be explored to complement the AgencyÂs safeguards system at regional level, and Thailand looked forward to cooperation between the Southeast Asia NuclearÂ­Weapon-Free Zone and the Agency in building up a regional safeguards system and fostering regional cooperation in the peaceful uses of nuclear technologies. 
176. Thailand appreciated the AgencyÂs continued efforts to enhance the security of nuclear material and radioactive sources, in particular through the development of the Nuclear Security Plan 2010Â 2013. It welcomed the AgencyÂs role in assisting Member States to establish and maintain effective nuclear security, including through capacity building, guidelines, human resources development, and the provision of assistance with the implementation of relevant international legal instruments. 
177. Her country was committed to establishing a safety and security system for emergency response, which would help to strengthen the mechanisms for notification, licensing, border control, inspection and enforcement. It also recognized the productive role of the Asian Nuclear Safety Network in the sharing of technical knowledge and practical experience to improve further the safety of nuclear installations in the region. 
178. During the 27th ASEAN Ministers on Energy Meeting held in Myanmar in July, ASEAN countries had agreed to develop further the ASEAN nuclear energy cooperation subsector network to serve as a regional nuclear safety network in response to the growing interest in nuclear energy in South East Asia. 
179. Through the technical cooperation programme, her country cooperated closely with the Agency to promote peaceful uses of technology, which contributed to its efforts to achieve the Millennium Development Goals. Many useful projects had been implemented with the assistance and cooperation of the Agency. In the field of health, Thailand aspired to become a centre of excellence in the region for PACT through the development of multidisciplinary cancer capacity-building projects to enhance sustainability in developing Member States. In agriculture, she welcomed the cooperation between Thailand and the Agency in improving the SIT as the major component of sustainable, environmentally friendly and cost-effective integrated pest control. Thailand was willing to offer its expertise as a centre for SIT technology transfer in South East Asia. 
180. Like many other countries, Thailand was seeking to diversify its energy supply sources, including through the use of nuclear energy. It was exploring ways of forging regional nuclear cooperation on a voluntary and non-binding basis to study issues relating to the civilian use of nuclear energy, as well as safety, capacity building, education and training, information sharing and public information. As a party to the Bangkok Treaty, Thailand was obliged to conduct a nuclear safety 
assessment prior to embarking on a peaceful nuclear energy programme. It was therefore seeking the AgencyÂs technical support and guidance on a number of aspects which were essential to build a safe, reliable, efficient and widely accepted nuclear power programme. 
181. Her country also looked forward to strengthened cooperation with the Agency to enhance further the development and security of nuclear energy in the region. Such cooperation might encompass strategies to encourage private sector participation and strengthen joint initiatives by the public and private sectors to develop and implement future programmes and activities. 
182. Thailand supported the international efforts to find a peaceful solution to the Iranian and DPRK nuclear issues. While respecting the inalienable right of all parties to the NPT to use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes, Thailand urged Iran to cooperate fully with the Agency. It joined others in calling upon the DPRK to comply fully with its international obligations. The six-party talks remained the main mechanism for achieving peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula, and she urged all parties to return to that process as soon as possible.

8. 	General debate and Annual Report for 2008 (continued) (GC(53)/7) 

1. Ms KJAZIMI (The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia) said that living in a world under threat from nuclear terrorism and other acts involving nuclear material was a reality. Hence, the AgencyÂs role was crucially important. Recognizing that the primary responsibility for security rested with Member States, her country had adhered to instruments that aided international efforts to strengthen non-proliferation, nuclear verification and export control. The preceding week, her countryÂs Parliament had ratified the Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management. 

2. The fact that her country was eligible to receive support under the EU Joint Action IV agreement proved that it would play an active role in the implementation of the EU Strategy against the Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction. Missions carried out by European Union and the Agency had identified the countryÂs needs with respect to further improvement of physical protection of nuclear applications, border control management and the necessary legal and regulatory infrastructure. 

3. The independent Radiation Safety Directorate, with the AgencyÂs assistance, had made significant progress in building capacity for effective radiation protection and nuclear safety. Of particular importance were its efforts to establish a central storage facility for low-and intermediate-level radioactive waste. Further assistance would be required to make the facility fully operational. 

4. The AgencyÂs Department of Technical Cooperation had provided significant assistance in the implementation of her countryÂs national technical cooperation programme. The Department should maintain its primary role of responding to Member StatesÂ needs as identified in their CPFs. The 2010Â2015 CPF for her country was in its final stage of revision. The current national technical cooperation programme focused on human health, agriculture and food safety, nuclear knowledge management and strengthening the capabilities of radiation safety services. Application of nuclear technologies in the field of human health was still considered to be of utmost importance. To prove its commitment, the Government had contributed ?4 million to the project on establishing a PET centre, for which Agency support was crucial. 

5. As a result of successful cooperation with the Agency, some of the countryÂs institutions had already been acknowledged as centres of excellence and training centres and were ready to welcome experts from the region for future training programmes. Her country had also hosted many Agency events under the regional technical cooperation programme and hoped to continue such activities in the future. 

6. In spite of severe economic conditions, her countryÂs Government had always met its obligations to the AgencyÂs Regular Budget and had provided significant extrabudgetary contributions to the TCF. 

7. Ms RODRÃGUEZ MANCIA (Guatemala) said that the authorities of her country had specifically requested that she comment on the job done by the Director General over the preceding twelve years and pay tribute to his dedication and his tireless efforts to achieve the AgencyÂs goals. He had worked hard so that all countries could benefit from the peaceful uses of nuclear energy in its 
various applications, for the good of humanity and the development of nations. The well-deserved Nobel Peace Prize which he had shared with the Agency bore testimony to his great efforts and had had an impact on the most vulnerable populations through the creation of the IAEA Nobel Cancer and Nutrition Fund. She conveyed to him the affection and gratitude of the Government and people of Guatemala and expressed support for the new Director General. 
8. Guatemala actively supported all initiatives promoting disarmament and non-proliferation, those being fundamental principles of its foreign policy. As a party to the Tlatelolco Treaty, Guatemala was part of the first densely populated nuclear-weapon-free zone on the planet. It had a safeguards agreement in force with the Agency and an additional protocol. The latter had been signed during the Director GeneralÂs official visit to Guatemala in 2001. In addition, all of the domestic requirements were being fulfilled under the Guatemalan Constitution to ratify the CTBT as early as possible. 
9. Her country firmly believed in the inalienable right of all States to have access to nuclear energy and its peaceful uses, but along with that right came certain obligations, such as the obligation to comply with the AgencyÂs safeguards regime. In that connection, she called on all countries which did not yet have safeguards instruments in force to sign them without delay so that the Agency could fulfil its mandate, and she called upon those which did have them to facilitate their full implementation. 
10. Guatemala recognized the AgencyÂs fundamental role in the fields of verification, nuclear safety and technical cooperation, the three pillars of the organizationÂs Statute, and it stressed the need for balance among those pillars. 
11. The demand for nuclear energy for peaceful uses, especially among developing countries facing increasing challenges which far exceeded their technological and financial capabilities, made it essential that Agency technical cooperation receive greater financial resources so that programme implementation was assured, predictable and sufficient. It was therefore becoming increasingly urgent that technical cooperation no longer depend on voluntary contributions. 
12. The technical cooperation programme for Guatemala contributed to the countryÂs social and economic development, complementing to a large extent the efforts of the Government to advance its social agenda. 
13. Two new projects had been approved for Guatemala in the 2009Â2011 cycle, one on strengthening of cancer therapy and the other on support for development of human resources and nuclear technology. 
14. In addition, work continued on establishing a laboratory for nutrition diagnosis and evaluation in connection with chronic diseases in Guatemala and Central America. Projects were also under way in agriculture to enhance the nutritional value of grains. 
15. The medfly programme centre based in Guatemala had received fellows from various parts of the world, contributing to efforts to eradicate the medfly. GuatemalaÂs efforts to develop its own human resources had benefited greatly from the countryÂs participation in the training programmes offered by the Agency in a variety of areas. 
16. Guatemala appreciated the enormous contribution made by the Agency in promoting nuclear energy which was one of the cleanest low-cost sources of energy. It therefore welcomed the fact that the topic of the Scientific Forum that year had been energy and development. 
17. Efforts to connect the electricity grids of Mexico and Central America were quite advanced, and Colombia had joined those efforts. The Agency should consider regional approaches as a way of achieving greater benefits for countries in that area. 
18. Discussion was taking place at national level of GuatemalaÂs CPF, which would identify existing needs and strengths with a view to taking fuller advantage of opportunities for cooperation with the Agency. Work was in progress at national level to strengthen coordination among institutions, and the work of the National Liaison Officer, intensifying efforts to make the opportunities offered by the Agency for technical cooperation more widely known to the public, academia and the private sector. Her country was grateful to the Agency for the cooperation it had provided. 
19. Having taken part that year in the informal discussions on the future of the Agency, Guatemala firmly believed there was a need to work towards a consensus in the discussions in order to strengthen the Agency to face the challenges and opportunities that lay ahead. Guatemala remained willing to participate constructively in that process. 
20. Mr STACEY MORENO (Ecuador) said that the multilateral system and its resolutions had to be strengthened in order to tackle the challenges and threats facing humanity arising from a lack of mutual trust, rifts caused by the reorganization of world power and the pressing need for fairer, more balanced social and economic development to consolidate the peaceful coexistence of nations. Over half a century had elapsed since the AgencyÂs first General Conference and, during that time, the international community had witnessed the positive development of an organization that worked actively and tirelessly for nuclear non-proliferation, safety of nuclear facilities and activities, and expansion of the benefits of nuclear applications, particularly in developing countries. However, it still had a long way to go to meet fully its objectives, ensuring that nuclear technology Â rather than causing destruction or concern Â was accessible to all as an effective tool for combating poverty and promoting sustainable human development. 
21. Ecuador promoted peace and universal disarmament, condemned the use of weapons of mass destruction and was committed to nuclear non-proliferation. It belonged to the worldÂs first densely populated nuclear-weapon-free zone and rejected any non-peaceful nuclear programme, and it supported any proposals and efforts aimed at reducing nuclear arsenals. 
22. Given the potential consequences of accidents or malicious acts involving nuclear material, radioactive sources and nuclear technologies, States had to make every effort to control them. That was not only a national responsibility, but a commitment shared by the international community. 
23. His country was in favour of an international regime for the safe transport of radioactive material that covered liability for damage to human health and the environment, and economic loss that could occur in the event of an accident or incident. It was also very important to have prior, transparent and clear communication among States on shipments, especially by sea. Dialogue between shipping and coastal States should continue, as it was of mutual benefit. 
24. Ecuador recognized the Agency as the competent authority to verify and ensure compliance with safeguards agreements, so as to prevent the diversion of nuclear knowledge, technology and material for non-peaceful purposes. It was important to strive for universal application of the AgencyÂs safeguards system, including by those countries currently outside the regime. Adherence to the NPT should not be considered merely as an option, but as a priority for the international community to guarantee global and regional security. There was also a need to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East, and Ecuador urged all countries to adopt the measures required to facilitate the suggested approach to that issue and promote the forum on it recommended by the General Conference in 2000. 
25. His country maintained a principled position on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons. It firmly believed in the inalienable right of all States party to the NPT to develop research, production and use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes without discrimination, provided that they complied in a full and transparent manner with their obligations under the non-proliferation regime. Diplomatic 
dialogue was very important for finding a peaceful and lawful solution to international conflicts. Ecuador rejected the adoption of unilateral measures of force outside the multilateral United Nations system and international law. 
26. Given the expansion of nuclear power, the demand for nuclear fuel cycle services, and the related proliferation risks, all options for assuring nuclear fuel supplies needed to be examined in depth. Ecuador was willing to support the most viable initiatives that were proliferation-resistant and allowed countries to benefit from the use of nuclear power. 
27. EcuadorÂs Constitution included a vision for an energy mix that relied less on fossil fuels and aimed at use of cleaner energy, also taking into consideration the nuclear option. The devastating effects of climate change had forced all countries to rethink their development models. Ecuador had presented an initiative that involved leaving around 900 million barrels of crude oil untouched in the subsoil of the YasunÃ­ national park, thus preventing environmental contamination with 410 million tonnes of carbon. That initiative would help combat global warming, and protect an area that was home to tribes living in voluntary isolation and had one of the highest biodiversity levels in the world. 
28. Ecuador had proposed building a development strategy that was more inclusive and non-exploitative to eradicate poverty and ensure a decent life for all human beings, in which the nuclear renaissance would play an important role. Lasting security could not be achieved without sustainable human development. Technical cooperation was the means by which modern States and international bodies contributed to the progress of humanity. One of the areas in which Ecuador had received technical cooperation from the Agency was nuclear medicine, in the form of cancer diagnosis and treatment equipment, so it was very interested in the benefits of PACT. The country also valued agricultural projects on improvement of seed varieties, use of fertilizers and aquifer characterization, whose results had been extremely positive. In the 2009Â2011 programme cycle, the Government would expand the use of nuclear technology in industry, especially in the oil, mining and agro-industrial sectors, with the collaboration of the Agency and a sizeable financial contribution from the country. 
29. As part of its restructuring process, Ecuador had given special attention to the national competent authority for nuclear energy, which was reflected in the high level of project implementation and the sectorÂs growing capacities. 
30. Special thanks were owed to the AgencyÂs Incident and Emergency Centre and the French Government for their timely and efficient humanitarian support in treating an Ecuadorian citizen who had suffered serious radiation exposure but who had now recovered. 
31. Ecuador attached special importance to ARCAL and appreciated the efforts made by the Department of Technical Cooperation to strengthen it. 
32. Mr QUIÃONES (Dominican Republic) said that science was one of the main motive forces for progress and the well-being of humanity. Nuclear applications played a prime role in finding solutions to problems affecting humanity, and peaceful uses of nuclear energy could be found in practically all spheres of life. The AgencyÂs efforts to promote and develop such applications, transfer technology to Member States, elaborate safety standards for nuclear activities and verify the peaceful use of nuclear material were of fundamental importance if nuclear science was to be a source of progress. 
33. The President of the Dominican Republic had stressed the importance of promoting the development of nuclear science and technology to ensure the well-being and sustained development of the population. The AgencyÂs technical cooperation programme had helped the country to develop its capacities in that field. Thanks to the national authoritiesÂ interest in promoting and diversifying the peaceful uses of nuclear energy and supporting technical cooperation with the Agency, the country 
had been able to increase its participation in national and regional projects and had hosted many Agency regional courses and activities, thus enhancing its staff training opportunities in areas of fundamental interest for its development. 
34. Ongoing Agency projects in the health field in the Dominican Republic focused on strengthening radiotherapy services in national cancer hospitals. The Government recognized the importance of PACT and appreciated the mission sent to the country in October 2008 which had contributed substantially to the development of an integrated national cancer control strategy. 
35. Agency technical cooperation would help the country improve its logistical and human capacities for the sustained management of aquifers, to assure drinking water supplies for rural communities and develop optimal strategies for conserving soil and extending the useful life of dams. 
36. Agency support for the creation of a nuclear applications and research centre would allow the Government to have access to a nuclear analytical techniques service centre for public and private institutions. 
37. In the energy field, the Agency provided invaluable assistance to developing countries in weighing up the appropriateness or feasibility of the nuclear power option, given the pressing need to diversify the energy mix, reduce dependence on oil and decrease emissions of polluting gases into the atmosphere. 
38. Agency assistance with strengthening the national nuclear and radiation safety infrastructure was also essential for the safe use of nuclear applications in the country. 
39. The Government thanked the Department of Technical Cooperation, particularly Ms Cetto and the Division for Latin America, for their valuable support for and commitment to constantly extending and improving the scope and sustainability of technical cooperation projects. In June 2009, his Government had been delighted to sign a CPF setting the short-and medium-term priorities of the technical cooperation programme in the Dominican Republic in the areas of health, radiation protection and nuclear safety, water resources management and environmental protection, energy, agriculture, industry and national capacity building. The document, which had been drawn up in accordance with the GovernmentÂs vision for national development, would allow nuclear applications to make an even greater contribution to socio-economic development. The new President of the National Energy Commission, Mr RamÃ­rez, hoped to continue promoting the peaceful uses of nuclear energy in the country. During his time as Secretary of State and President of the Commission, Mr FernÃ¡ndez Zucco had made a valuable contribution in that regard, and his dynamism and commitment to the issue had allowed the country to make considerable progress. 
40. His countryÂs CPF objectives included the implementation of binational projects with Haiti. Nuclear energy could help considerably in resolving problems affecting the two countries occupying the same island, particularly in the areas of health, energy, environment and water resources. The AgencyÂs support would be appreciated in designing mechanisms to allow the two countries to cooperate more closely. 
41. With respect to regional cooperation, the Dominican Republic attached great importance to ARCAL as the main instrument for nuclear cooperation in the region, and it had applied to host the regional meeting of the ARCAL Technical Co-ordination Board in 2010. It appreciated the AgencyÂs support for ARCAL, and the support provided by the Spanish Research Centre for Energy, Environment and Technology. The Dominican Republic had hosted several meetings for ARCAL regional projects in 2009. 
42. The AgencyÂs efforts to prevent the use of nuclear material for the construction of weapons of mass destruction or for terrorist acts, and to protect the public and the environment from the dangers 
posed by radiation were of fundamental importance for international peace and security. Aware as it was of the importance of international cooperation in that regard, in recent years his Government had signed an additional protocol and ratified the CPPNM and the International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism. In June 2009, the country had expressed its support for the Code of Conduct on the Safety and Security of Radioactive Sources and the supplementary Guidance on the Import and Export of Radioactive Sources. 
43. The Dominican Republic supported the AgencyÂs activities aimed at strengthening the participation of Caribbean countries in international initiatives related to the safe and peaceful use of nuclear energy. In February 2009, an Agency regional seminar on nuclear safety, security and safeguards had been held in Santo Domingo, attended by over 50 representatives from 22 countries of the Caribbean region. In October 2009, the country would also host a regional training course on the security of radioactive sources. 
44. His Government supported the international communityÂs efforts in the field of nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation aimed at ridding the world of the serious threat posed by nuclear weapons. The country was party to the NPT and the Tlatelolco Treaty and was committed to the principles enshrined in those instruments. The AgencyÂs verification measures, which provided assurances of the peaceful use of nuclear material, were important and the Dominican Republic therefore supported the AgencyÂs safeguards regime as strengthened by the additional protocol. 
45. Mr DIALLO (Burkina Faso) said that the General Conference was being held against a backdrop of heightened awareness of the need for the international community to establish world peace, as evidenced by the high-level meeting held in Berlin on 15Â16 July 2008 to discuss security and cooperation. Establishing a global security structure could bring hope and should provide citizens of the world with greater opportunities to improve their living conditions. The world was facing threats which not even the strongest States could overcome or control on their own, such as terrorism, the proliferation of weapons, including small arms, climate change, large-scale pandemics and food insecurity. The list was far from exhaustive, but those threats could imperil globalization. 
46. The emergence of those challenges, and the need to tackle them through integrated strategic action within the United Nations system, called for a new era of responsibility, a new path of multilateral cooperation. More than ever before, the Agency needed the backing and support of all its Member States to face those new challenges, and it needed to put in place a verification regime that was both robust and effective. 
47. The Director General, in his address to the South African Institute of International Affairs in July 2009, had argued that the events of recent years had put the non-proliferation programme under greater strain than ever before. The challenges remained numerous and the international community needed to continue to strive to strengthen the non-proliferation regime, of which the NPT was the cornerstone. 
48. Non-proliferation should mean all States committing themselves to complying fully with the provisions of the NPT and adhering fully to the CTBT. The 2005 NPT Review Conference had failed to produce a consensus document, but it had provided an opportunity to reaffirm the importance of the NPT. Burkina Faso hoped that the 2010 NPT Review Conference would make real progress. 
49. Africa served as a good example in that area, as almost all African countries had adhered to the Pelindaba Treaty which had come into force in July 2009. Burkina Faso counted on the international community to help preserve that achievement and assist Africa to look to its future by investing its resources in sustainable development. 
50. His country supported the universalization of safeguards and reiterated its commitment to the AgencyÂs safeguards system. It called on others who had not yet done so to adhere to the relevant instruments. Burkina Faso had approved the modification to the SQP in February 2008, thus achieving full adherence to Agency safeguards, which was a clear indication of its desire to use nuclear energy for socio-economic development. 
51. At national level, his country had strengthened structures regulating the peaceful use of nuclear energy. In 2007, it had established two institutions: the Technical Secretariat for Atomic Energy and the National Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Authority. The former promoted the peaceful use of nuclear energy, while the latter was responsible for regulating its use to protect the health of the population and the environment. The establishment of those institutions had been followed by a seminar for members of the Government, relevant State bodies and civil society on the role the atom could play in the socio-economic life of the country and on the security and safety measures which needed to be implemented. The Government of Burkina Faso appreciated the technical assistance it had received from the Agency in organizing that event, and in implementing a national capacity-building programme for radiation protection under its CPF for 2007-2011. 
52. It was clear that the aforementioned institutions would not be able to achieve their respective goals without a national nuclear information programme in place. The establishment of the national INIS centre, with the assistance of the Agency, aimed at addressing that issue. 
53. Technical cooperation was one of the main activities of the Agency. Burkina Faso welcomed the positive impact of such cooperation. Since joining the Agency, Burkina Faso had been involved in a number of regional projects relating to power, health, nutrition, water and the environment. 
54. It was participating in a tripartite Model Project with Mali and the Agency on combating of trypanosomosis using the SIT, which programme had been strengthened with the advent of PATTEC. The 51st General Conference had decided to strengthen Agency support for that project. 
55. Malaria was another scourge which seriously hindered the socio-economic development of sub-Saharan countries. The efforts made by the Agency to address that problem were greatly appreciated. Thanks to them, it had been possible to demonstrate that dietary supplements of vitamin A and zinc could reduce malaria incidence by over 30%. That important result had been publicized in the media owing to its great socio-economic significance. It had prompted the Agency to turn the national project in question into a regional project, including Mali, Ghana and Cameroon. 
56. He commended the AgencyÂs efforts to combat cancer through PACT. Establishing a partnership with the WHO would be a great asset, particularly for developing countries, in the fight against cancer. 
57. His country was conscious of the efforts made by the Agency to meet the growing energy needs of developing countries. Those efforts should continue, focusing on energy demand planning projects and taking into account capacity building. An evaluation of energy sources in West Africa showed that nuclear power would be the most credible option in 2030, along with hydroelectric and solar power. Action was needed to develop and build strategic partnerships in order to realize that goal. The region had the third largest uranium reserves in the world. 
58. Burkina Faso was also keen to promote education and research in nuclear science and technology, strengthen radiation safety and security, and improve knowledge of groundwater resources and the management of air quality in cities. 
59. Finally, he thanked those States that had supported his countryÂs election to the Board of Governors. 
60. Mr MIFSUD (Malta) said that his country looked forward to a successful outcome of the 2010 NPT Review Conference and was encouraged by the outcome of the third session of the Preparatory Committee. Malta called on States that were not parties to the NPT to join as non-nuclear-weapon States as soon as possible. 
61. The role of the Agency in ensuring that States complied fully with their safeguards obligations under the NPT was an integral and indispensable part of the international nuclear non-proliferation regime. Thus, the Agency had to be provided with the tools it needed to detect and deter the diversion of nuclear material for illicit use. 
62. Malta was of the view that a comprehensive safeguards agreement together with an additional protocol constituted the current Agency verification standard. It urged States to bring into force comprehensive safeguards agreements, as required under the NPT, without delay. It also called on all States that had not yet done so to sign and ratify an additional protocol as soon as possible. 
63. The continuing uncertainty surrounding the nature and scope of the nuclear programme of the Islamic Republic of Iran was a matter of serious concern. Despite some recent modest progress, after six years the Agency was still unable to provide assurances regarding the peaceful nature of IranÂs nuclear programme. Malta hoped that, in the coming weeks, steps would be taken to rebuild confidence between Iran and the international community. Implementation of the additional protocol would be an important step in the right direction. 
64. His country was also concerned by the actions taken by the DPRK whose recent nuclear test made the early entry into force of the CTBT a matter of even greater urgency. Malta hoped that significant progress would be made in that regard in the coming months. It urged the DPRK to return to the six-party talks and to resume cooperation with the Agency without delay. In the interests of regional and global security, the DPRK should abandon its nuclear weapons programme in a transparent, verifiable and irreversible manner. 
65. As more and more countries considered adding nuclear power to their energy mix, the need for the highest standards of nuclear safety was self-evident. A decision by a State to exercise its right to develop nuclear energy required that it did so in a safe and secure manner. Safety and security remained primarily the responsibility of the States themselves. However, Malta applauded the important role played by the Agency in supporting Member StatesÂ efforts to enhance their safety and security infrastructures. In developing new or expanded nuclear energy programmes, the strictest safety standards must be assured. 
66. The possibility of malicious acts employing nuclear material remained a continuing threat that required constant vigilance. His country appreciated the important role played by the Agency in assisting States to control nuclear material and radiation sources, protect nuclear facilities and strengthen border controls. Illicit trafficking of sensitive nuclear material posed an enormous challenge in the area of non-proliferation. Malta supported measures that enhanced the capabilities of States to prevent and respond to illegal acts involving nuclear and other radioactive material. It had become the 107th Member State participating in the illicit trafficking database programme. It was also taking steps to ratify the amendment to the CPPNM. 
67. As a coastal and leading maritime flag State, Malta viewed with serious concern the increase in incidents of piracy and armed robbery at sea. It supported recent efforts to address that new threat at the global as well as regional level. 
68. The AgencyÂs technical cooperation programme continued its sterling work in various sectors, addressing development needs in some of the worldÂs poorest countries. His country benefited from technical cooperation in a number of fields and participated in several regional programmes in areas 
ranging from human health to the preservation of cultural heritage artefacts. With Agency assistance, MaltaÂs public health services had also been extended in the field of cancer treatment and medical imaging, which would culminate in the establishment of a new specialized oncology centre. Malta also welcomed the initiative of the Secretariat to prepare a strategy for technical cooperation in Europe. 
69. Mr BARROS OREIRO (Uruguay) said that his country based its international activities on the guiding principles of the Charter of the United Nations and was therefore proud to be one of the first countries to be involved in the ÂDelivering as OneÂ initiative. Uruguay continued to follow the AgencyÂs work with great interest and made every effort to collaborate in activities that promoted the uses and benefits of atomic energy. 
70. In July 2009, his country had hosted the meeting of the ARCAL Technical Co-ordination Board, when it had assumed the presidency of that body. It was also about to assume the presidency of the Board of ARCAL Representatives. 
71. Uruguay was committed to nuclear verification and non-proliferation. It also hoped that synergies could be found between radiation safety and security and recognized the need to increase international cooperation in those areas. However, unnecessary obstacles should not be created for countries that had proven themselves to be trustworthy. 
72. In accordance with the recommendations of his GovernmentÂs preliminary study on the possible establishment of a nuclear programme for electricity generation, a commission had been created that was responsible for coordinating the first milestone in the Agency publication entitled Milestones in the Development of a National Infrastructure for Nuclear Power (IAEA Nuclear Energy Series No. NG-G-3.1). The commission had been active since March 2009 and comprised politicians and technical staff not only from the Government, but also from the four political parties with parliamentary representation. He thanked the Agency for the assistance it had provided in that regard through various regional technical cooperation projects. He also expressed support for the efforts of those countries that had developed initiatives to assure the non-discriminatory supply of nuclear fuel. 
73. Uruguay remained eager to develop its cooperation with the Agency and had been implementing a number of projects with it since 2000. New projects to be implemented related to: the development of PET facilities, R&D laboratories and radiopharmaceutical production for the diagnosis of cancer and AlzheimerÂs disease; determination of antibiotic and pesticide residues in food exports; increasing profitability in dairy production through appropriate methods and the rational and sustainable use of genetic resources; preparatory programmes for introducing irradiation techniques; the commissioning of a linear accelerator to treat cancer patients; the establishment of a secondary standards laboratory for calibration in radiotherapy; and use of high-dose-rate brachytherapy in public health. Uruguay had been paying regularly its voluntary contributions to the TCF to ensure that the Agency could meet its objectives. 
74. In his country, 75% of nuclear technology used was for medical applications Â for both diagnosis and treatment. The remaining applications were in industry, agriculture and the environment. Radiation safety was thus a priority, with intensive work being implemented in that area under the AgencyÂs technical cooperation programme. A technically independent national regulatory authority had been approved and consolidated by law. There had been continued improvement in safety with regard to medical exposure, both for patients and health care professionals. The Government had approved a national radiological emergency plan and Uruguay was one of only three countries in Latin America that had adhered to and ratified the Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management. The country had passed by decree a national strategy for safe management of radioactive waste, being one of only three Latin 
American countries to have such a strategy. It had also ratified the additional protocol and had been applying integrated safeguards since January 2009. 
75. The Agency was facing considerable challenges as a result of the evolving political and international security situation, and the need to provide technical and financial support to countries wishing to achieve sustainable development through extensive cooperation programmes related to nuclear energy. The organization needed to continue to play a decisive role in the universalization of the peaceful uses of nuclear energy, non-proliferation, banning of nuclear testing and nuclear disarmament. It must fulfil the mandate conferred upon it by Member States in the areas of safety and security, technical cooperation and safeguards, working independently, transparently and efficiently. The Agency would continue to be at the centre of international nuclear cooperation, but it had to be protected. 
76. The level of support developing countries expected from the Agency, principally in the area of technical cooperation, was of particular relevance in the light of the global economic crisis and the Millennium Development Goals. 
77. Illicit trafficking in nuclear material could only be addressed if all States acted together to prevent the theft, diversion and use of nuclear material and technology. Uruguay was firmly committed to peace and nuclear disarmament, which was why it had signed the Tlatelolco Treaty in 1968. 
Mr Davies (United States of America) took the Chair. 

78. Mr ZOGRAFOS (Greece) said that his country fully supported the AgencyÂs continually expanding nuclear safety and security programmes and welcomed the Nuclear Security Report 2009. It also looked forward to the implementation of the Nuclear Security Plan 2010Â2013. 
79. Since the preceding year, Greece had participated in the review meeting of the Contracting Parties to the Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management, demonstrating full compliance with its obligations. It had also ratified the Additional Protocol to the Convention on Third Party Liability in the Field of Nuclear Energy in August 2009. It followed the Code of Conduct on the Safety and Security of Radioactive Sources and had implemented it, together with the European Union Council Directive on the control of high-activity sealed radioactive sources and orphan sources, in its national legislation. Greece was implementing a comprehensive nuclear security system and contributed its experience to the AgencyÂs efforts in that area by hosting fellows and regional training courses. 
80. He commended the high priority the Agency gave to the threat of nuclear terrorism. New measures and mechanisms were needed to combat illicit trafficking in sensitive nuclear equipment and technology. Greece had been one of the first to join the AgencyÂs illicit trafficking information system, which had been established in 1995 and now had over 100 members. It participated in the Proliferation Security Initiative and was a member of the Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism. It had also signed the amendment to the CPPNM and had ratified the International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism. Greek experts also actively contributed to the drafting of new nuclear security standards and practices. 
81. The NPT remained the cornerstone of the nuclear non-proliferation regime and the continuing success of Agency safeguards depended to a very great extent on political support at the international and regional levels. Greece hoped for a successful outcome to the 2010 NPT Review Conference and supported further strengthening the AgencyÂs role. 
82. Many countries were considering the nuclear option, and thus the need for cooperation with the Agency and implementation of its milestones would steadily increase. Robust international standards and independent regulatory authorities were needed. 
83. The most effective response to nuclear proliferation and threats to international security was, without question, broader participation in the NPT, the conclusion of comprehensive safeguards agreements and implementation of the additional protocol. Ratification of the CTBT and early drafting of a fissile material cut-off treaty were also important. 
84. The Director GeneralÂs latest report on Iran pointed out once again that countryÂs failure to comply with United Nations requirements and to cooperate fully with the Agency. The Agency was still unable to provide credible assurances regarding the absence of undeclared nuclear material and facilities in that country, and Iran had still not implemented the additional protocol, nor cooperated with the Agency in connection with the outstanding issues which needed to be clarified in order to rule out any possible military dimension to its nuclear programme. Instead, contrary to United Nations Security Council resolutions, Iran had continued to expand its enrichment activities and work on heavy water-related projects. 
85. It was essential that Iran comply with Security Council resolutions and Board requirements and he urged the Iranian authorities to cooperate fully with the Agency, in particular by making a full disclosure of any nuclear weapons-related work and by facilitating Agency verification. Greece called upon Iran to renew diplomatic negotiations with the five permanent members of the Security Council and Germany on the basis of the most recent offer. 
86. His country was also looking forward to seeing the Agency fully exercise its mandate in Syria. 
87. Greece deplored the DPRKÂs actions in conducting additional nuclear tests and stepping up its missile programmes, which put at risk all efforts made in the six-party talks to achieve the complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. It also found the DPRKÂs decision to expel Agency inspectors highly deplorable. 
88. The linkage between nuclear supply assurances and nuclear non-proliferation had been the subject of major debate since before the beginning of negotiations on the NPT. The urgent need to address that issue, along with the Director GeneralÂs relentless efforts, had brought closer the idea of establishing an assured supply mechanism to strengthen non-proliferation and meet growing demands. That idea had been highlighted in the joint declaration of the Presidents of the United States and the Russian Federation in July 2009, who had given voice to their vision of an international approach with the ultimate goal of establishing nuclear fuel cycle services to secure the nuclear weapons nonÂ­proliferation regime. 
89. The centre of such a mechanism, as a short-term solution covering the front end of the fuel cycle, was a fuel bank under Agency auspices which would operate in a non-political and non-discriminatory way applying non-proliferation and other criteria. His country fully supported that plan and, as a member of the European Union, was working for its early implementation. However, it remained to be seen to what extent it would prove a credible solution for the interested parties. 
90. The Greek Atomic Energy Commission was recognized as an Agency regional training centre in radiation protection and nuclear security and it organized and regularly hosted the upgraded postgraduate course in radiation protection and the safety of radiation sources, as well as seminars on security issues. An educational technical assistance mission had been organized in November 2008 prior to the signing of a long-term agreement between the Commission and the Agency on the provision of education and training in radiation protection. 
91. The European Conference on Individual Monitoring of Ionizing Radiation, organized by the Greek Atomic Energy Commission in cooperation with the Agency, the European Commission and the European Radiation Dosimetry Group, would take place in Athens in March 2010. 
92. Finally, Greece considered that the report of the Commission of Eminent Persons on the future of the Agency constituted the cornerstone of membersÂ efforts to meet the challenges the Agency would have to face in the year 2020 and beyond. 
93. Mr AL-SHAKAR (Bahrain) said the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Bahrain had informed the General Conference at its fifty-first session that his country had joined the Agency because of the importance it attached to the organizationÂs role in promoting peaceful uses of nuclear energy and in preventing the production of nuclear weapons or other types of nuclear explosives. Bahrain aspired to make an effective contribution to the Agency and fully subscribed to its principles and goals. It encouraged national efforts to obtain appropriate training and nuclear technology for peaceful applications in all areas that would serve development needs. In addition, it had recently ratified the safeguards agreement it had signed in 2007, and the Cabinet had approved the establishment of a national commission on peaceful uses of nuclear energy in June 2009. 
94. The States of the Gulf Cooperation Council had also laid the basis for close cooperation on peaceful uses of nuclear energy, particularly with respect to nuclear and radiation safety, application of nuclear science and technology for power generation, and nuclear verification and security. 
95. Bahrain had reaffirmed at a number of international events its strong support, as a matter of principle, for efforts to prevent all forms of nuclear proliferation. It was concerned at the threat posed by continued nuclear weaponization and urged that non-proliferation efforts should go hand in hand with action to bring about complete nuclear disarmament under international oversight. 
96. With regard to application of the safeguards regime, his country was strongly of the view that a nuclear-weapon-free zone should be established in the Middle East, including in the Gulf region. It appealed to the international community to rid the Middle East of all weapons of mass destruction as a contribution to international peace and security, and to compel all States that were not party to the NPT to accede to it and place all their nuclear installations and activities under Agency safeguards. The countries of the Middle East lived in fear of IsraelÂs military nuclear arsenal. That countryÂs possession of nuclear weapons and its refusal to comply with international law constituted a threat to peace and security not only in the region but in the world as a whole. 
97. His country counted on the Agency to apply effective safeguards in the Middle East, in accordance with General Conference resolution GC(50)/RES/16, as a confidence-building measure and a contribution to the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the region. 
98. The Gulf region had experienced a series of devastating wars over the preceding three decades and did not wish to repeat the experience. In view of the regionÂs vital economic role, those wars had also had a major impact on the global economy. Bahrain therefore reiterated its call for a peaceful solution to the issue of IranÂs nuclear programme through dialogue and diplomacy and not military confrontation. At the same time, his country reaffirmed the right of all countries to use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes in accordance with their Agency safeguards agreements. 
99. Bahrain, which had acceded to the NPT in 1988 and to the CTBT in 2004, aspired to participate effectively Â together with the other Member States of the Agency Â in achieving the objectives of the Statute, namely to enlarge the contribution of atomic energy to peace, health and prosperity throughout the world, and to strengthen international cooperation in the area of nuclear safety and in protecting present and future generations from the harmful effects of ionizing radiation. 
100. Mr MONNET (CÃ´te dÂIvoire) said that his country had developed and implemented, with Agency support, a CPF outlining its main policy directions in the nuclear field. CÃ´te dÂIvoire had been a member of the Agency since 1963 and had centred its cooperation with the organization around the benefits nuclear energy could bring in terms of socio-economic development in such areas as agriculture, animal production and health, and the agro-food industry. Many successful and beneficial projects had been implemented in those areas. 
101. CÃ´te dÂIvoire had developed an extensive programme to harness its water and fossil fuel resources to meet its demand for energy. The demand for electricity was growing on the order of 10% a year as a result of industrial development, rising household consumption and exports. At the same time, the water resources available to hydroelectric power dams were unpredictable owing to climate changes, and natural gas supplies were inadequate and expensive. The deficit in the electricity sector was becoming untenable and there were real outage risks. Meanwhile, CÃ´te dÂIvoire was a major player in the West African power pool. 
102. The need to find sustainable solutions for social progress, and for meeting the growing energy needs of CÃ´te dÂIvoire and of countries in the West African subregion served by it, had prompted his countryÂs Government to make efforts in two directions: on the one hand, to improve socio-economic welfare by reaping the benefits of nuclear science and technology in the field of human health, animal production and health, drinking water availability and environmental protection; and on the other hand, to move towards nuclear power generation projects as a way to meet the electricity needs of CÃ´te dÂIvoire and neighbouring countries. That solution required mobilizing significant financial resources for infrastructure development, but there appeared to be no alternative to nuclear power that would provide electricity that was clean, abundant and environmentally friendly. 
103. Hence, CÃ´te dÂIvoire was increasing its cooperation with the Agency, along the lines defined in its CPF, in response to a growing interest in addressing human development issues, eradicating poverty, protecting the environment, meeting energy needs and developing the mining industry. The Government was seeking to maximize the return on such projects by enacting and strengthening a suitable legal and regulatory framework which would result in the establishment of institutions for managing nuclear activities, and the creation of a national nuclear energy commission and a regulatory authority which would incorporate an effective radiation protection centre, and by making available to the public a radiation therapy and nuclear medicine reference centre. 
104. He thanked the Agency for its efforts through PACT to expand the training of doctors and oncologists and mobilize traditional and non-traditional donors. Cancer was a problem in developing countries and the activities of PACT and the WHO augured well for the future of cancer treatment in those countries. His country was grateful for the support it had received and continued to receive in that connection. 
105. AFRA had succeeded in consolidating technical cooperation among member States, and in developing national and regional human resources in nuclear science and technology. It played a major role in mobilizing resources and regional expertise to meet the challenges faced by countries in Africa and offered an ideal framework for development, sharing experience and strengthening national capacities. CÃ´te dÂIvoire was committed to collaborating more closely with the programme. 
106. His Government had agreed on significant efforts to pay off its assessed programme cost arrears, and the payment of its contribution to the TCF was in progress. Despite the funding difficulties in connection with the crisis recovery programme, 80% of outstanding debts had been paid off, and by the end of 2009 all its debts to the Agency should have been paid off. 
107. CÃ´te dÂIvoire was fully committed to the AgencyÂs objectives and would spare no effort to promote the peaceful use of nuclear technology, or to strengthen the non-proliferation regime and 
work in close cooperation with the international community to bring about peace, security and prosperity. Nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation were ongoing tasks and the NPT remained the cornerstone of the international nuclear non-proliferation regime. CÃ´te dÂIvoire hoped that, through the negotiations in progress, the international community would move closer to full implementation of that Treaty. It had signed a protocol additional to its safeguards agreement and was determined to ratify and implement it. It had also ratified the Pelindaba Treaty. 
108. The international community had been devoting more attention recently to environmental problems and illicit trafficking in toxic and radioactive substances. The Agency should redouble its efforts to assist Member States with radiation protection, decontamination and protection of the environment. CÃ´te dÂIvoire encouraged the Agency to enhance and make more generally accessible suitable techniques for managing environmental risks. 
109. The risks of nuclear terrorism remained high and the Agency had an important role to play in that area. CÃ´te dÂIvoire supported all initiatives in that regard and was acting in full awareness of its responsibility to ensure nuclear security within its borders. 
110. Mr MOKGOTHU (Botswana) said that the AgencyÂs role in assisting Member States was widely recognized and it had helped many countries to achieve self-reliance in various nuclear applications. At a time when the world was facing challenges such as natural disasters, disease, security threats and economic problems, it was encouraging to note that the AgencyÂs programmes were increasingly recognized as providing viable and sustainable solutions to such problems. 
111. In an effort to meet its obligations as a Member State of the Agency, Botswana had joined the NPT, had signed a safeguards agreement and an additional protocol, and was committed to the Code of Conduct on the Safety and Security of Radioactive Sources. The Agency played an important role in promoting and facilitating cooperation in the peaceful use of nuclear energy and was the sole internationally recognized authority for verifying that such activities were not diverted to non-peaceful purposes. 
112. The Agency had provided Botswana with invaluable assistance and support in the form of expert advice, monitoring equipment and staff training. Nuclear technology was widely used in various industries in the country and, since it clearly stood to benefit significantly from such technology, efforts were being made to maximize and promote the safe and peaceful uses thereof. His country was grateful for the technical cooperation projects being implemented for the benefit of the population, and for the cordial relationship that it had with the Agency. The benefits derived from the technical cooperation programme bore witness to the relevance of nuclear applications in tackling the challenges facing developing countries. 
113. Botswana was making ongoing efforts to control HIV/AIDS, and undertaking research in food and nutrition intervention techniques using stable isotopes with the AgencyÂs assistance. Such endeavours were expected to bear fruit in the near future. The countryÂs CPF was under review in order to make it more focused and align it with National Development Plan 10. Botswana was committed to finalizing the new CPF before the start of the 2010Â2011 project cycle so that it could form the basis for new project proposals. 
114. Mr NYAPHISI (Lesotho) said that, as a new member of the Agency, his country would do its best to work harmoniously with the organization and contribute to its work. It hoped that the Agency would continue to increase the support available to LDCs to meet their agendas for peace security and prosperity through nuclear technology applications relating to food security, health, water resources management, energy and the environment. 
115. It was essential to strive for a world free of nuclear weapons and to achieve the Millennium Development Goals in order to ensure a better future for current and future generations. 
116. Lesotho was in the process of concluding its additional protocol and had also recently amended its SQP. It encouraged all States to do likewise. 
117. Mr TZOTCHEV (Bulgaria) said that full compliance with the NPT, transparency in nuclear programmes, and a universal non-proliferation regime backed by strong safeguards were essential for the peaceful use of nuclear energy. His country considered a comprehensive safeguards agreement and an additional protocol to be the current standard for Agency verification and it supported the strengthening, universalization and strict implementation of multilateral non-proliferation, arms control and disarmament treaties. As one of the first countries to have signed and ratified the additional protocol, Bulgaria called for its universalization. 
118. Bulgaria was deeply concerned at the DPRKÂs decision to withdraw from the NPT and resume work on the production of high-enriched uranium, and at the recent tests carried out by that country. It called for continued efforts to find a diplomatic solution to that problem within the framework of the six-party talks. 
119. Recognizing the importance of nuclear-weapon-free zones in strengthening the nuclear non-proliferation regime and regional peace and security, his country welcomed the entry into force of the Pelindaba Treaty and was in support of making the Middle East a nuclear-weapon-free zone. 
120. While it respected the inalienable right of every country to develop nuclear programmes for peaceful purposes, Bulgaria was deeply concerned over the lack of transparency shown by Iran in connection with Agency verification activities and called on that country to restore the international communityÂs confidence in the peaceful nature of its nuclear programme. IranÂs ratification and implementation of the additional protocol it had already signed would be a major step in the right direction. 
121. The preceding two years had been important ones in the development of the nuclear power sector in Bulgaria, with the completion in 2007 of the modernization programme for Units 5 and 6 of the Kozloduy nuclear power plant. An Agency mission had been invited to assist Bulgarian experts in evaluating the results of the programme, in the interests of ensuring transparency and independent expert evaluation. The experts had been impressed by the number and complexity of the activities carried out under the programme, and the excellent results of the review had given Bulgaria confidence that the combined efforts of the regulator and the operator to improve safety were proving successful. 
122. Another important issue for Bulgaria was construction of new nuclear plants. The licensing process for the Belene nuclear power plant was under way, and the Bulgarian Nuclear Regulatory Agency was finalizing its review of the technical design, the safety analysis report and the probabilistic safety assessment. Bulgaria had been seeking broad international support in that process through requests for assistance from relevant international organizations, chief among them the Agency. To support the Bulgarian regulator in evaluating the probabilistic safety assessment, a preliminary mission and an expert mission had been conducted by the Agency in February and May 2009 and the final report had been submitted to the Bulgarian authorities in June 2009. He thanked the Agency for the promptness and effectiveness of its assistance to the Bulgarian regulatory authority in its licensing activities. Leading European technical support organizations were providing good support in connection with the intermediate safety analysis report on the new build, assisting the Bulgarian regulator with the quality and adequacy of documentation, compliance with Bulgarian laws, international standards and good practices, and additional research into and verification of certain safety aspects. 
123. The 16th annual meeting of the forum of State nuclear safety authorities of countries operating WWER type reactors had been held in Bulgaria in July 2009. The main objective of the meeting had been to exchange experience and information, and it had been attended by regulators from every country operating or constructing WWER type reactors, and by Agency observers. Each member of the forum had had the opportunity to report on salient national issues and developments in nuclear regulation and safety, which had been followed by a peer discussion. Bulgaria appreciated the AgencyÂs support for the forum, which it believed would have an overall positive impact on regulatory activities. 
124. Technical cooperation had always been and would remain an important part of the AgencyÂs activities. Bulgaria, as a member of the European Union, was considering its changing role within the technical cooperation partnership and was trying to define a new strategy and mechanisms for future cooperation. His country shared the view that cooperation among countries in the region should be based on exchange of information and know-how at regional level, rather than the procurement of tools for responding to individual national needs only. The main task for Europe was to promote knowledge sharing and best practice within the region, and Bulgaria was ready to continue providing experts and training facilities. In light of the fact that funding for technical cooperation should be assured, sufficient and predictable, Bulgaria paid its annual contribution to the TCF fully and on time and had pledged its next contribution during the current General Conference.

8. 	General debate and Annual Report for 2008 (continued) (GC(53)/7) 

1. Ms ZIMBA (Zambia) said that the issue of nuclear proliferation continued to be of great concern. Therefore, her country welcomed the statements by the Presidents of the United States and the Russian Federation affirming their commitment to non-proliferation and to achieving a world free of nuclear weapons. Zambia hoped that concrete action would follow. The proposed fissile material cut-off treaty and the entry into force of the CTBT ought to have already been implemented and Zambia urged those Annex 2 States on which the entry into force of the CTBT depended to meet their international obligations. Her country was in the process of acceding to the African Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone Treaty, which had entered into force on 15 July 2009. Non-proliferation must be approached in a broad-based and unselfish spirit. 
2. She noted with satisfaction the AgencyÂs measures aimed at strengthening technical cooperation, especially with developing countries like Zambia. In particular, she welcomed the efforts to provide assistance to Member States with energy planning and management, which was essential for their development. Since the preceding General Conference, Zambia had developed a new CPF, had developed and applied its legal framework for uranium mining with the support of the Agency, and had strengthened its capacities in cancer treatment, nuclear medicine, livestock productivity, animal nutrition support services, and the monitoring of nutrition intervention programmes, through human resources development as well as provision of equipment. It still faced a number of challenges, including delays in establishing an autonomous radiation protection agency owing to human and financial resource constraints, and a limited capacity for monitoring the mining of uranium and other radioactive minerals or other mining activities. 
3. Her Government continued to support AFRA and she congratulated that programme it on its twentieth anniversary and on enhancing technical cooperation among Member States in the region. Her country continued to receive AFRA expert missions in various fields and was committed to honouring its outstanding financial contributions to AFRA. Finally, Zambia pledged its full share of the TCF target for 2010. 
4. Mr WIN (Myanmar) said that the Agency had made a valuable contribution to socio-economic development by helping Member States to utilize nuclear science and technology in both power and non-power applications. Nuclear technology and radioisotope techniques had been applied in various fields, including electricity production, the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of diseases, food safety and security, sustainable land and water management, insect pest control, environmental protection, and industry. 
5. Developing countries had benefited from the activities and support of the Joint FAO/IAEA Division of Nuclear Techniques in Food and Agriculture in using nuclear and isotopic techniques to increase crop yields, produce disease-resistant crops, and control infectious animal diseases. PACT and the WHO-IAEA Joint Programme on Cancer Control had helped save the lives of cancer patients and should be continued in future years. 
6. The AgencyÂs technical cooperation programme was of great importance in transferring nuclear science and technology to Member States and promoting the peaceful uses of atomic energy for sustainable socio-economic development. His country was grateful to the Agency for its role in promoting nuclear technology for peaceful purposes. 
7. Myanmar was currently implementing 10 technical cooperation projects, two of which were new in the 2009Â2011 cycle. The country had participated in regional and interregional projects and in RCA activities. 
8. Since 2000, most of the AgencyÂs assistance to Myanmar under the technical cooperation programme had been concentrated in the fields of radiation medicine and health, food and agriculture, radiation safety and security, atomic energy development, and nuclear engineering and technology. In the preceding year, the Agency had provided Myanmar with significant assistance in improving crops through radiation-induced mutation, using the SIT against the diamond back moth, and enhancing the capacity of the nuclear instrument laboratory at the Department of Atomic Energy. He thanked the Agency for its assistance and expressed the hope that it would be sustained and strengthened as much as possible. 
9. Through the AgencyÂs efforts to strengthen international cooperation in nuclear, radiation, and transport and waste safety, Member States had received assistance with improving their national nuclear safety infrastructures by means of international safety instruments, the development and preparation of safety standards and safety guides, nuclear safety knowledge networks, and capacity-building work in various areas of radiation safety. 
10. Myanmar was taking steps to develop and strengthen its national infrastructure related to the promotion and application of nuclear science and technology for peaceful purposes. The national programme focused on education and the human resources development for nuclear technology, human health, food security and safety, agriculture and livestock breeding, water resources management and sustainable energy development. His country hoped to benefit from technical cooperation in the fields of capacity building, human resources development and nuclear knowledge management. 
11. Turning to nuclear terrorism and the establishment of an effective global nuclear security regime, he said it was important to strengthen the protection of nuclear and other radioactive material, detection of and response to malicious acts, and collection and sharing of relevant information among Member States. His country fully supported the AgencyÂs efforts to improve nuclear security by upgrading the physical protection of nuclear facilities, ensuring quality control of nuclear security equipment, promoting nuclear security education, and facilitating and implementing international nuclear security instruments in Member States. 
12. Myanmar was a supporter of global nuclear non-proliferation and a nuclear-weapon-free world. In the interests of peace and security, States should refrain from misusing their peaceful nuclear programmes for weapons-related purposes. The AgencyÂs verification programme would continue to play a vital role in providing assurances to the international community regarding the peaceful nature of nuclear activities. 
13. His country had been a party to the NPT since December 1992. Thereafter, it had signed a safeguards agreement, an SQP, the CTBT, and the Treaty on the Southeast Asia Nuclear Weapon-Free Zone. Nuclear-weapon-free zones were effective tools for promoting non-proliferation and disarmament. 
14. One challenge that Myanmar currently faced was that it had no major nuclear facility. A nuclear research reactor with experimental facilities would be an indispensable tool for education and training, research and other peaceful applications in nuclear science and technology. In 2007, the governments of the Russian Federation and Myanmar had signed a cooperation agreement on the construction of a nuclear research centre in Myanmar, including a pool-type research reactor and facilities for radioisotope production, neutron activation analysis and silicon doping. All related nuclear material, 
equipment and facilities would be under Agency safeguards for the duration of their existence or application in Myanmar. However, the implementation phase of the centre had not yet begun. 
15. Pursuant to the NPT and MyanmarÂs SQP, a seminar and bilateral consultation meeting had been held in Yangon in November 2008. A team of Agency experts from the Department of Safeguards and officials from the relevant ministries of Myanmar had participated in the seminar, which had focused on the safeguards system and the application of safeguards to the nuclear material and facilities covered by the amended SQP and the additional protocol. 
16. Mr ALOBIDI (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya) said it was essential to preserve the credibility of the Agency by ensuring balance between the three pillars of its activities. Libya urged all States without exception, both nuclear-weapon and non-nuclear-weapon States, to accede to the NPT and to comply with the safeguards regime. The Agency was the only body with the mandate to oversee that regime. At the same time, it was the job of the Agency to ensure that all States benefited from scientific progress, including in the field of uranium enrichment, provided that their activities served peaceful aims. In a statement delivered at the NAM Summit in Egypt in July 2009, President Qaddafi had pointed out that, although the Agency had been established to promote both nuclear energy and development, the development dimension had been eclipsed by the nuclear dimension. His country therefore welcomed the statement of the Director General elect that he intended to draw the worldÂs attention to the AgencyÂs role in promoting development. When objections were raised to uranium enrichment activities, access to development assistance was barred and nations were prohibited from taking advantage of contemporary scientific advances. 
17. Libya was deeply grateful to the Agency for its recent support for projects in the national priority areas of health and water resources management. It had submitted five proposals for technical cooperation projects for the 2009Â2011 cycle in the areas of health, water, environmental protection and energy planning. They had been approved as strategic national projects under LibyaÂs CPF. 
18. Libya paid its voluntary contributions to the TCF with a view to strengthening its partnership with the Agency. It had established an Atomic Energy Commission and had drawn up a road map consisting of two components. One focused on existing programmes in the areas of medicine, water, industry and the environment, and the other dealt with the use of nuclear energy for electricity generation and seawater desalination. It had signed agreements and memorandums of understanding with a number of countries and had acceded to relevant international instruments. Libya was currently drafting nuclear legislation and taking the necessary steps to select and evaluate sites for nuclear power plants. It was relying on legal and technical assistance from the Agency under its national project on the introduction of nuclear energy. 
19. He urged the Agency to abide by the principle of impartiality and to refrain from imposing political or economic conditions on its assistance to Member States. He also emphasized the responsibility of advanced countries to assist developing countries in using nuclear energy for peaceful purposes by facilitating their access to nuclear material and equipment and by transferring relevant scientific and technical knowledge. 
20. Libya supported the AgencyÂs efforts to promote international cooperation in the area of nuclear and radiation safety. It had acceded to the Convention on Nuclear Safety and the Convention on Early Notification of a Nuclear Accident, and had established a national regulatory office that would eventually become an independent regulatory agency applying Agency standards under existing national legislation. Libya participated in meetings, workshops and training courses on nuclear safety and was a party to the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material and the International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism. 
21. With regard to the Director GeneralÂs report on the implementation of the safeguards agreement with the Islamic Republic of Iran, he reiterated his countryÂs view that the carrot-and-stick approach and threatening language would never achieve a satisfactory settlement for all parties involved. Moreover, sanctions had never succeeded in compelling States to abandon their rights and sovereignty, and they invariably hit ordinary people harder than decision-makers. Such approaches merely generated extremism. 
22. As President Qaddafi had said at the recent NAM Summit in Egypt, countries should be given assistance in the field of uranium enrichment. Then there were two paths they could follow: the red path and the green path. The red path should be blocked off, because it led to the manufacture of nuclear weapons, whereas the goal was to achieve global nuclear disarmament. However, blocking both paths was unjust and amounted to withholding of knowledge. If Iran was claiming to be enriching uranium in order to produce an atomic bomb, the world would be justified in mounting strong opposition to its plan. However, if it stated that it was enriching uranium for peaceful purposes, it should be encouraged to do so. In any case, it was the business of the Agency and not political leaders. 
23. Libya commended Iran on its recent cooperation with the Agency, which it had permitted to inspect its nuclear research reactor and improve surveillance measures at the fuel enrichment plant. His country urged Iran to step up its cooperation in order to dispel any remaining doubts regarding its nuclear programme. Dialogue and negotiations were the most effective way of handling such an important issue. 
24. His country condemned IsraelÂs attack on the Syrian Arab Republic, a sovereign independent country, and its destruction of what it alleged to be a nuclear facility in blatant defiance of the international community. Israel had also encroached on the AgencyÂs mandate as the sole authority empowered to inspect nuclear activities. He praised the Agency for carrying out an investigation, despite the difficulty of the task, and he also commended SyriaÂs cooperation, urging the authorities to comply fully with their obligations under the Syrian safeguards agreement. 
25. In a historic initiative, Libya had voluntarily abandoned equipment and programmes that might have led to the production of internationally prohibited weapons on 19 December 2003. President Qaddafi had stated at the NAM Summit in Egypt that Libya had closed off the red path, an act that had been confirmed by the Agency and major world powers. They now had a responsibility to assist Libya in following the green path and using the atom for peaceful purposes. Since that historic date, Libya had cooperated fully with the Agency. He took the opportunity to thank the Director General, Mr ElBaradei, for his professionalism and impartiality. His achievements had boosted international confidence in the Agency and had led to the award of the Nobel Peace Prize to the organization and its Director General. 
26. Libya was deeply concerned about the ongoing threat to the Middle East from IsraelÂs possession of nuclear weapons and that countryÂs unwillingness to admit the fact. The existence of a nuclear programme that remained outside the AgencyÂs safeguards regime, and IsraelÂs refusal to accede to the NPT posed an immediate threat to international and regional stability, undermined the credibility of the non-proliferation regime and was likely to promote an arms race in the region. 
27. More than 14 years had passed since the 1995 NPT Review and Extension Conference had adopted a resolution on the creation of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East. That resolution had been one of the main incentives for the accession of the Arab States to the NPT, but it had not been implemented owing to IsraelÂs intransigence. It was only natural to wonder why certain States failed to demand that Israel should accede to the NPT and all other relevant treaties, while calling for sanctions against other States solely on the suspicion that they might have a military nuclear programme. 
28. His country called on the nuclear-weapon States to draw up a programme to eliminate their nuclear arsenal and to halt all programmes aimed at developing such weapons, as required by Article VI of the NPT and the Final Document of the 2000 NPT Review Conference. 
29. He praised all African Member States that had signed and ratified the Pelindaba Treaty, which had entered into force in 2009. While the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Africa was a step in the right direction, the security of African, Arab and other countries would remain under threat as long as even one nuclear weapon still existed, not to mention the arsenals possessed by the nuclear-weapon States. If they failed to disarm, there was little point in creating nuclear-weapon-free zones. 
30. He expressed the hope that the current session of the General Conference would discuss the agenda item on Israeli nuclear capabilities. His country deplored the opposition at the two preceding sessions to its inclusion in the agenda and even to a discussion of its inclusion. Such conduct afforded clear evidence of the application by some States of double standards to the countries of the Middle East. Policies based on a desire for hegemony and on contempt for other nations and peoples and their sensitivities would simply promote extremism and violence. He therefore strongly urged all peace-loving States with a sense of justice to give the Conference an opportunity to hold an impartial discussion of an agenda item with major implications for international peace and security. 
31. Libya welcomed the positive developments announced recently by President Obama of the United States concerning a nuclear disarmament initiative, his undertaking to ratify the CTBT and to begin serious negotiations on an international instrument to ban the production of fissile material, and the convening of a United Nations Security Council meeting on 24 September 2009 at Head of State and Government level to discuss the proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear disarmament. Libya hoped that the meeting would issue a strong declaration regarding the risks inherent in the production and possession of nuclear weapons and the need for serious negotiations on their irrevocable reduction to a minimum level as soon as possible, and their eventual elimination. Provision should also be made for an international mechanism to verify compliance. 
32. Finally, Libya appreciated the role of the Arab Atomic Energy Agency in assisting the Arab States to consolidate their infrastructure for peaceful uses of nuclear energy. It called for closer technical cooperation between that Agency and the International Atomic Energy Agency to that end. 
33. Ms INTERIANO TOBAR (El Salvador) said her country recognized the importance of the AgencyÂs role in promoting international cooperation for the peaceful use of nuclear energy. The international community should continue its efforts to eliminate nuclear weapons and consolidate nuclear-weapon-free zones, which made a significant contribution to international peace and security. El Salvador was a party to the Tlatelolco Treaty, which had established the first nuclear-weapon-free zone. Her country looked forward to the 2010 NPT Review Conference. 
34. The CTBT also played an important role in nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation efforts and El Salvador continued to support the adoption of appropriate measures aimed at accelerating its entry into force. Her country supported the conference on facilitating the entry into force of the CTBT to be held in New York later that month pursuant to Article XIV of that Treaty. It called on all States that had not yet done so to sign and ratify the Treaty, and to maintain a moratorium on nuclear testing to demonstrate their good intentions and as a confidence-building measure. 
35. With regard to safeguards, El Salvador recognized the importance of the SQP in ensuring effective verification of Member StatesÂ compliance with their obligations. As part of the technical cooperation provided by the Agency in that area, El Salvador had benefited from training sessions and advice on proper presentation of its reports, and was making efforts to modify swiftly the standard SQP text. 
36. Her country attached great importance to technical cooperation activities and valued the efforts of the Deputy Director General for Technical Cooperation. It particularly appreciated Agency assistance with achieving the Millennium Development Goals and improving national development objectives in areas such as human health, agriculture, water resources management and energy generation. It was important to continue to seek additional funds for technical cooperation projects, and to maintain a balance in the allocation of funds to the three pillars of the AgencyÂs activities. In that regard, she welcomed the consensus that had been reached on the AgencyÂs budget for 2010 and expressed the hope that it would open the way for the regularization of the TCF, thus providing more opportunities for sustainable development. 
37. El Salvador was currently implementing its national projects under the 2009Â2011 cycle and, thanks to the AgencyÂs assistance, it now made greater use of isotope hydrology for water resources development and management. The Agency had provided assistance with the training of staff for a geothermal energy project and, as a result, El Salvador was now able to offer advice to other countries in the region in that field. 
38. In the human health field, the Agency had played a notable role in helping her country improve its capacity to control cancer. El Salvador attached great importance to PACT and it called on donor countries to continue to strengthen that programme, which had a direct impact on the peopleÂs lives. She commended the efforts of the Pan American Health Organization in the field of cancer prevention in Central America and the Dominican Republic, and the WHO-IAEA Joint Programme on Cancer Control. El Salvador had also benefited from fellowships awarded to oncologists, physicists, doctors, environmental experts and academics over the period 2006Â2008. 
39. With regard to the Director GeneralÂs report on strengthening of the AgencyÂs activities related to nuclear science, technology and applications, her country was disappointed at the lack of activities in the Latin American and the Caribbean region compared with other developing regions. The Secretariat should redouble its efforts to remedy that situation. 
40. With regard to regional cooperation, El Salvador was participating in over 20 regional projects in the fields of human and animal health, the environment, food security, energy security and radiation safety. She welcomed the fact that Paraguay, Colombia and Nicaragua had ratified the ARCAL agreement, which provided a unique opportunity for establishing horizontal cooperation programmes. 
41. With regard to the report on measures to strengthen international cooperation in nuclear, radiation, transport and waste safety which, among other topics, addressed the issue of support to Member States embarking on nuclear power programmes, the Secretariat should continue to provide the cooperation requested by Member States to increase their capacity for analysis and assessment of the development of their programmes relating to energy generation, energy planning and energy and environmental policy. 
42. Mr KAHUURE (Namibia) said that 2009 marked the start of the new technical cooperation programme cycle and his country was pleased that the Board of Governors had approved four national projects for Namibia, bringing the total number of national projects being implemented to seven. Namibia also participated in a number of regional projects covering a wide spectrum of nuclear technology. As a developing country, it looked to nuclear technology to help attain its development goals, including energy security, food security and public health, to mention but a few. 
43. Steps had been taken to establish a national committee on cancer control to facilitate a coherent and coordinated approach to cancer management. With the assistance of the Agency and WHO, Namibia hoped to develop a comprehensive national cancer control programme for the effective implementation of preventive, diagnostic, curative and palliative measures. He commended the Agency for the assistance provided to Member States in building their capacity for cancer 
management, as well as for its concerted efforts to make a meaningful contribution to the fight against HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria which, along with cancer, were some of the major diseases that most of the developing countries were grappling with, including his own. His country called on the Agency to continue to strengthen technical cooperation activities in those crucial areas of public health. 
44. Nuclear applications also played a key role in diagnosing animal diseases, which was crucial to sustaining and expanding access to international markets for meat and meat products. Nuclear technology also assisted with making crops drought-resistant and improving yields, thus improving food security. Given NamibiaÂs arid climate conditions, cooperation in those areas needed to be enhanced. 
45. Namibia was endowed with uranium resources and played a significant role in the uranium mining industry. With uranium mining and milling activities increasing in Namibia and Africa as a whole, his country was pleased that the Agency had started initiatives to help Member States respond to the challenges associated with uranium mining and processing, especially with regard to the policy and regulatory framework. His GovernmentÂs objective was for the countryÂs natural resources to be exploited for the economic benefit of all without undue health and environmental risks for current and future generations. 
46. His country aspired to draw economic benefit from its uranium resources and to generate nuclear electricity using its own natural resources. It was an ambitious but not impossible ideal. In that connection, the efforts of the Agency in assisting Member States to develop their national nuclear power programmes were commendable. His country would continue to engage the Agency to initiate a nuclear power programme and undertook to develop the core human resources capacity, in line with Agency recommendations, in preparation for a potential nuclear power capability. 
47. The ingredients for a successful technical cooperation programme were well defined projects supported by the necessary coordination and technical skills to implement the programme. The availability of qualified and skilled personnel was central to optimal performance of technical cooperation projects. In that regard, he called on the Agency to assist Namibia and other developing countries by reviewing its policy on requirements for qualification for Agency fellowships. 
48. Mindful as it was of the risks associated with the use of nuclear technology, Namibia was committed to play its role to promote safety and security in both the national and international context. That demanded a responsive regulatory framework that was effective and efficient to guarantee that full use was made of nuclear technology without unduly causing harmful consequences. In that connection, Namibia had inaugurated its first Atomic Energy Board and approved the regulatory authority to develop and implement a regulatory infrastructure commensurate with the extent of its nuclear applications. The legislative foundation had been laid for an effective and efficient regulatory regime that would ensure controlled and monitored use of nuclear-related technologies, safety and security of radioactive and nuclear material, safety of patients exposed to radiation, safety of workers involved in radiation-related activities, safety and secure management of radioactive waste, and capability to respond to nuclear or radiological emergencies. The Atomic Energy Board would work closely with the Agency to ensure that the Namibian regulatory system was appropriate and operated within internationally approved standards. 
49. With regard to the 2010 NPT Review Conference, he said that the work of the Agency had direct bearing on the NPT and Namibia would work with other State parties for an outcome which would further enhance and strengthen implementation of all the three pillars of the NPT regime. All countries cherished a world of peace where nations and peoples could live together in harmony and peace, a world free from the threat of nuclear weapons. Namibia therefore welcomed the entry into 
force on 15 July 2009 of the African Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone Treaty, which was an important step for regional peace and security. Namibia had signed the Treaty and would soon ratify it. 
50. The slogan ÂAtoms for PeaceÂ was not empty words. It served as a constant reminder to humanity of the ongoing human suffering in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. It also was a call to apply nuclear technology to create a world of prosperity and free from want. No country should be denied its inalienable right to develop its nuclear technology for peaceful purposes. At the same time, comprehensive safeguards should not be optional; non-proliferation and nuclear disarmament were an obligation for all. Only adherence to universal standards would guarantee the safety and security of the planet from the dire consequences of nuclear weapons. 
51. Ms MUTANDIRO (Zimbabwe) said that the Agency had provided valuable assistance to her country in the peaceful application of nuclear techniques. Under ZimbabweÂs CPF for the period 2005Â2009, collaboration had focused on human and livestock health, agriculture, industrial applications, radiation safety and hydrology, and the projects undertaken had impacted positively on her countryÂs socio-economic development. Her Government sincerely appreciated the technical cooperation programme and the support received from the Secretariat. In the light of the emerging nuclear renaissance, Zimbabwe hoped to move into new strategic sectors in its next CPF, and to develop the capacity required by strengthening further its bilateral cooperation with the Agency. 
52. The AgencyÂs technical cooperation programme had played a critical role in facilitating the use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes, especially in developing countries. In Africa, the impact of programmes on cancer therapy, tsetse fly eradication using the SIT, food security through improved water management and crop production, industrial applications and energy production was better appreciated when viewed within the context of efforts to attain the Millennium Development Goals. The Agency continued to place greater value on projects which enhanced human health, agricultural productivity and environmental protection. 
53. Her country, with many others, called for sufficient, assured and predictable funding for technical cooperation through the AgencyÂs Regular Budget, particularly in view of the increasing demand from developing countries. Over the preceding decade, developing countries had expressed their concern about the voluntary nature of the TCF. Technical cooperation and assistance must be given the same priority as safeguards and nuclear safety and security. It was time for a paradigm shift in technical cooperation funding policy. The technical cooperation programme had been the main conduit for the transfer of nuclear applications to the developing world. The collective endeavour to attain sustainable global peace and security could not be realized in a world full of abject poverty and deprivation. 
54. Her country had been privileged to chair the third session of the Preparatory Committee for the 2010 NPT Review Conference. She urged Member States to take realistic and achievable measures to advance the three pillars of the NPT in a balanced manner. 
55. The need to strengthen capacity for nuclear security and safety in Member States had become more compelling than ever as a result of the increase in nuclear applications. She commended the AgencyÂs efforts to help Member States prevent illicit trafficking in nuclear and other radioactive material. In her own country, the Agency had helped establish a regulatory framework and had provided the training and equipment required for the creation of the radiation protection authority of Zimbabwe. She appealed to the Agency and Member States to support those efforts and expressed gratitude for the ongoing support to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of ZimbabweÂs national regulatory body in line with international best practices for nuclear safety and security. 
56. Nuclear security was the responsibility of national governments but, owing to the lack of human and material resources in developing countries, international collaboration was needed to strengthen 
nuclear safety, radiation protection and waste management. Her country was thus pleased to have been included in the IAEA/EU Joint Action IV strategy against the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, which would help strengthen its regulatory infrastructure and nuclear security. 
57. Zimbabwe recognized that the NPT was the cornerstone of the global nuclear non-proliferation regime and that the Agency was the only institution with a mandate to verify StatesÂ compliance with their obligations. She commended the AgencyÂs objectivity, professionalism and impartiality in verification and safeguards implementation. Under Article IV of the NPT, all State Parties had the inalienable right to develop research, production and use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes, including the nuclear fuel cycle. However, it was also incumbent upon them to honour their obligations under the NPT and their safeguards agreements. She urged Member States to collaborate closely with the Agency and stressed that durable international peace and stability could only be based on resolution of disputes and not use of force. 
58. With regard to the several proposals on the table concerning assurance of nuclear fuel supplies, she noted that the issue was of great concern to all Member States and should be decided on the basis of consensus. 
59. Her country welcomed the creation of the Forum of Nuclear Regulatory Bodies in Africa, providing a valuable platform for an exchange of views on cooperation, know-how and best practices. It deserved the support of Member States. 
60. Her country had been following closely the deliberations of the open-ended working group on the future of the Agency. It supported efforts to strengthen the role of the Agency in line with its Statute. The discussion should be comprehensive and transparent and all decisions should be taken by consensus. 
61. Mr PETERSEN (Norway) said that the present time was one of challenges and historic opportunities. The recent commitment made by the President of the United States and other world leaders to a safer world without nuclear weapons was highly encouraging. The growing interest in nuclear energy had also reinvigorated the AgencyÂs work to promote safe, secure and peaceful nuclear technologies. The recent entry into force of the Pelindaba Treaty was a landmark that should give new momentum to the common goal of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East. 
62. The outgoing Director General had led the Agency through great challenges, preventing nuclear material and technology from being used for military purposes and ensuring that nuclear energy for peaceful purposes was used in the safest possible way, which had earned him and the Agency the Nobel Peace Prize in 2005. He thanked him for his work and congratulated him on his efforts and, congratulating the incoming Director General, he assured him of his countryÂs support. 
63. The Agency had been established to increase the contribution of nuclear energy to peace, health and prosperity, and to ensure that no assistance provided in that regard could be used to further military purposes. With the conclusion of the NPT, its mandate had been broadened. For more than half a century, the world had witnessed the importance of Agency safeguards, and Agency safety and security services, for the international non-proliferation and safety regimes. That was no less true now in the face of the persistent threat of nuclear weapons proliferation and terrorism, and the ever-present risk of a nuclear accident. Effectiveness in handling those challenges needed to be further enhanced. 
64. Key priorities included the peaceful resolution of the Iranian and DPRK nuclear issues. Iran must comply with its international obligations and cooperate fully with the Agency with a view to resolving all outstanding issues regarding its past or present nuclear activities. The DPRK must refrain from any further provocations, such as nuclear testing, and return to the six-party talks immediately and without preconditions. Nobody was calling into question any countryÂs right to the peaceful use of 
nuclear energy, but full compliance with relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions was expected. He urged Iran, the DPRK and other countries concerned to cooperate fully with the Agency. 
65. All Member States must collaborate to create a stronger, more viable nuclear non-proliferation regime. Additional protocols were crucial to the AgencyÂs verification activities and he called on all countries that had not done so, including Iran and the Syrian Arab Republic, to sign, ratify and implement an additional protocol at the earliest opportunity. Comprehensive safeguards agreements together with an additional protocol constituted the verification standard. 
66. All Member States should support the establishment of a nuclear fuel bank under the auspices of the Agency as a first step towards an equitable and safe multilateral nuclear fuel assurance regime. Such an arrangement would be voluntary and financed with extrabudgetary contributions from Member States. Its objective was to facilitate implementation of Article IV of the NPT. 
67. The prevention of nuclear accidents, sabotage or terrorism must remain a key priority. Norway had ratified all relevant international conventions and agreements, including the CPPNM, and urged all other Member States to do the same, and to make use of and support the AgencyÂs assistance programmes for their implementation. 
68. Nuclear risks must be addressed in a comprehensive manner, instead of waiting for disaster to strike. The capacity to secure swiftly any vulnerable nuclear material or radioactive sources must be increased. Nuclear disarmament was also part of that agenda and his country welcomed the initiative of the United States of America to address that challenge at the highest political level. 
69. Securing the safety of workers, citizens and the environment was a continuing challenge. Although the AgencyÂs safety standards were an indispensable reference, the organizationÂs statutory work suffered from unpredictable and insufficient funding and had done so far too long. Norway would like to see regular, predictable funding of the AgencyÂs safety work in future. 
70. Promoting the peaceful uses of nuclear energy and technology was at the heart of the AgencyÂs mandate. The Agency was increasingly being viewed as a development organization, as illustrated by the recent decisions of the OECD Development Assistance Committee. It could contribute positively to meeting the Millennium Development Goals, in close partnership with other United Nations bodies, and his country welcomed new reports on achievements in that field. 
71. Norway fully supported Article IV of the NPT and respected every countryÂs sovereign right to choose its own energy mix. However, nuclear energy must not come at the expense of non-proliferation, human safety or the environment, and it was not necessarily the best way to meet a countryÂs energy needs, as his country expected the 2009 Scientific Forum would confirm. The Agency must be ready to assist in the overall assessment of the options before Member States requesting assistance with energy planning. 
72. Finally, the Agency was one of the most important international organizations for security and sustainable development. It should seize the historic opportunity to strengthen the nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament regime by ensuring that the 2009 General Conference regained consensus on important decisions. 
73. Mr QUIMBAYA MORALES (Colombia) said that disarmament and non-proliferation were basic principles of his countryÂs foreign policy. Addressing those issues in multilateral forums, with full respect for the rights and obligations of States, was crucial to global peace and security. 
74. Colombia remained committed to the NPT and to the Tlatelolco Treaty, instruments that had enabled it to be part of the worldÂs first nuclear-weapon-free zone. It supported multilateral initiatives aimed at ridding the world of the nuclear threat. His country welcomed the AgencyÂs activities in the 
field of the peaceful uses of atomic energy, research, technology transfer, and prevention of the diversion of material, equipment and knowledge to military purposes. 
75. With Agency assistance, Colombia continued to develop its capacities and knowledge in a number of important areas, including health, agriculture and the environment. He drew attention to the XXII Congress of the Latin American Association of Societies of Nuclear Medicine and Biology to be held in Colombia in November 2009, which would provide an opportunity for sharing of knowledge and expertise concerning the application of nuclear techniques in human health. 
76. Colombia welcomed the AgencyÂs continued cooperation with the FAO, which had brought considerable benefits to the least developed countries. It also noted with concern that the technical cooperation programme lacked assured, predictable and sufficient funding and thought that the AgencyÂs technical cooperation function should be strengthened, particularly in view of its contribution to sustainable development. 
77. At the regional level, ARCAL had contributed to promoting and strengthening cooperation among developing countries during the 24 years it had been in existence. He was pleased to report that Colombia had ratified the Agreement in June 2009. 
78. With respect to the AgencyÂs verification activities, Colombia had ratified its additional protocol in March 2009. 
79. The threat of proliferation and terrorism required a joint effort at all levels. Colombia supported the development of a collective security system and the implementation of mechanisms that promoted transparency and confidence. 
80. Lastly, his country was confident that, under the leadership of the new Director General, the Agency would continue to meet the expectations of the international community with respect to promotion of the use of clean energy, transfer of knowledge and technology, and promotion of nuclear safety. 
81. Mr TAN (Singapore) said that, for the first time in the 21st century, there was renewed impetus in working towards a world free of nuclear weapons, thus raising hopes for progress in the global nuclear disarmament agenda. The success of the 2010 NPT Review Conference could impart a greater shared sense of purpose to deliberations on the future of the Agency. Indeed, the collective efforts and resources of all Member States would be needed to enable the Agency to face the challenges and seize the opportunities that lay ahead. 
82. The three pillars of the AgencyÂs work, namely safety and security, safeguards and verification, and science and technology, were complementary and of equal importance. As nuclear energy became an option for many countries, and with the increase in nuclear installations around the world, nuclear safety and security were crucial to avoid any catastrophic incident. Singapore endorsed the AgencyÂs work in support of StatesÂ efforts to ensure the highest standards of nuclear safety and security through the setting of benchmarks and through various Agency instruments, peer reviews, assistance and review missions. As the world entered a nuclear renaissance, a corresponding culture of nuclear safety must emerge. Regional and national efforts needed to be redoubled to bolster confidence in the use of nuclear power. In that connection, he noted the adoption by the European Union, on 25 June 2009, of a nuclear safety directive as a major step towards a common legal framework and a strong safety culture in Europe. 
83. In South-East Asia, several countries had either indicated an interest in, or were pursuing nuclear energy programmes to meet increasing energy needs. Singapore fully supported greater regional cooperation to complement and strengthen international and national efforts in the area of nuclear safety and security. In March 2009, the Singapore Energy Studies Institute had organized a 
one-day regional round table on achieving a safe and sustainable nuclear future, which had brought together ASEAN policy-makers and regulators and international nuclear experts to engage in a wide-ranging dialogue on the pursuit of civilian nuclear energy and attendant policy implications, including management of public concerns about nuclear safety. Beyond its endeavours in the ASEAN context, Singapore supported the efforts of the Asian Nuclear Safety Network to ensure a high standard of nuclear safety in the region. It had joined the network in December 2008 and had participated in the nuclear safety strategy dialogue meeting in April 2009. It would be hosting the tenth steering committee meeting in October. 
84. The right of States to use nuclear material for peaceful purposes must be exercised in compliance with their non-proliferation obligations. Singapore firmly believed that the Agency safeguards and verification regime must remain capable of responding credibly and effectively to new challenges within the AgencyÂs mandate in order to continue to provide safeguards assurances. Every State must also play its part at national level. In recent years, Singapore had improved its legislative framework to ensure compliance with the additional protocol and the modified SQP it had ratified and concluded with the Agency in March 2008. Just three weeks earlier, it had hosted a visit of Agency safeguards inspectors under the mechanism outlined in Article 8 of the additional protocol. 
85. The Agency had had several verification cases before it for a number of years. Singapore commended the Agency team, which often worked under difficult conditions when investigating those cases. It deeply regretted the path taken by the DPRK and urged it and all other parties concerned to return to meaningful dialogue soon. Singapore also hoped to see meaningful dialogue between Iran and the United States of America. It looked forward to an early clarification of the remaining issues of concern for the Agency, in the hope that the latter would then be in a position to exclude the possibility of a military dimension to IranÂs nuclear programme and bring the issue to a proper conclusion. 
86. The Agency's quiet work in promoting peaceful applications of nuclear science and technology was the area that no doubt had the greatest impact on the lives of people in developing countries, and it made a tangible contribution towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals. Yet the international news media had grossly under-reported that aspect of the AgencyÂs work. The benefits of nuclear applications were to be seen in human health in medical diagnoses and treatment, in pest control and applications in the petrochemical and mining sectors, in animal husbandry and the agroÂ­industries, in food processing and elsewhere. 
87. Singapore was pleased that the AgencyÂs technical cooperation programme had expanded considerably in recent years, both in its scope and in the number of activities, but there was still room for the organization to enhance its work further in that regard. The Agency was to be commended for establishing partnerships with international and regional development organizations to promote synergies. Singapore remained firmly committed to supporting the AgencyÂs technical cooperation programme, and it looked forward to cooperating with it further, through its Memorandum of Understanding with the organization, in outreach efforts to assist other developing countries. 
88. His country was keenly aware that a comprehensive and effective technical cooperation programme required adequate, steady and sustainable funding, and it would thus once again be pledging its full share of the TCF for 2010. It also continued to support regional activities undertaken under the RCA. In 2009 Singapore had hosted a number of scientific visits, fellowships and regional training events under the technical cooperation and RCA frameworks. 
89. The Agency, which was the only global platform for discussing a whole range of nuclear issues, could only be strong and effective if its Member States afforded it the support and resources it needed to carry out its mandate. Although some issues might seem divisive, Member States must strive to 
work constructively and guard against an increased politicization, which could generate mistrust and distract them from their common objective of supporting and strengthening the Agency. 
Ms MacMillan (New Zealand), President, took the chair. 

90. Mr MAZUMDER (Bangladesh) said that many developing countries in Asia and Africa had been most exposed to the shocks of the global financial and economic crisis through no fault of their own. There was a clear need to enhance the capacity of those countries to find sustainable solutions to the challenges they faced. Bangladesh, for its part, was striving hard to escape the vicious circle of poverty through various innovative and home-grown development initiatives. His Government had launched the Bangladesh Vision 2021, which sought to transform Bangladesh into a modern, technologically advanced and prosperous country by 2021, the fiftieth anniversary of its independence. To achieve its goals of poverty alleviation and sustainable development, the country needed to build a strong science and technology infrastructure, underpinned by an adequate and affordable energy supply. 
91. Bangladesh had limited energy resources of its own and its per capita consumption of energy and electricity was among the lowest in the world. His Government had identified specific targets and strategies for increasing power generation, and nuclear energy was being seriously considered as part of the overall energy mix. His Government was committed to implementation of the Rooppur nuclear power plant project and had requested the Agency to provide technical support in that connection. The Agency had conducted a mission in November 2008 to review the existing nuclear infrastructure based on the results of an integrated infrastructure evaluation conducted by Bangladesh, and had made recommendations based on the AgencyÂs Nuclear Energy Series document NG-T-3.2. His country was grateful for the assistance it had received and appreciated the approval of a technical cooperation project on nuclear power for the 2009Â2011 cycle. He also called upon the Agency to provide regular regional training courses to help ensure the availability of qualified human resources, which was a key factor in implementing a nuclear power programme. 
92. Financing remained a critical challenge for developing countries hoping to set up nuclear power plants. The Agency should make every effort to eliminate barriers to the construction of nuclear power plants in developing countries, and it should work with international financial institutions to assist those countries in building their civilian nuclear power facilities. 
93. The growing threat of non-communicable diseases like cancer, particularly in the developing world, was becoming a serious public health concern. Bangladesh was actively considering strengthening nuclear medicine and diagnostic techniques for cancer treatment, and was seeking the AgencyÂs assistance in establishing a cyclotron and PET centre. The number of people suffering from diabetes in Bangladesh was expected to increase from 3.8 million in 2007 to 7.4 million by 2025, and he noted with satisfaction that the Agency had started projects in several countries to strengthen nuclear medicine capabilities to detect complications related to diabetes. His country was seeking the assistance of the Agency in that regard. 
94. The recent increase in global food prices was putting enormous pressure on the poor around the world, and the rising global population and climate change were likely to compound the growing shortages of food. Food security was one of his GovernmentÂs key development priorities and the Bangladesh Atomic Energy Commission was working on plant breeding and genetics programmes employing nuclear technology to produce better crop varieties. 
95. His country appreciated the AgencyÂs work in the area of water resources management and was benefiting from technical assistance in the use of isotope techniques to improve freshwater and coastal water management. His Government was committed to ensuring safe drinking water for all by 2021, and it looked forward to the AgencyÂs continued cooperation in achieving that goal. 
96. Bangladesh was fully committed to the principles of nuclear safety and radiation protection and had intensified its activities in that regard. A draft nuclear law, which would be sent to the Agency for review prior to final approval, had been prepared to facilitate implementation of the countryÂs nuclear power programme. His Government looked forward to the AgencyÂs assistance in the establishment of an effective and independent regulatory body 
97. His country was fully committed to the peaceful use of nuclear energy. Its nuclear energy programme was transparent and it had signed all relevant international non-proliferation and verification instruments. 
98. He expressed appreciation for the assistance provided by the Agency through its R&D programmes on peaceful uses of nuclear energy. His country was making efforts to utilize the results of successful R&D programmes and hoped that Agency support for strengthening its own R&D capacity would continue to expand. 
99. Bangladesh was actively involved in various RCA projects, including CRPs. RCA programmes gave countries the opportunity to share experiences within a region and should be expanded. Programmes on the application of nuclear technology in industry, medicine, agriculture and other sectors would help the RCA countries to face the challenges of the 21st century. 
Â Restoration of voting rights 
(GC(53)/INF/10) 

100. The PRESIDENT noted that the General Committee, which had met earlier in the day, had had before it a request for the restoration of voting rights from the Gabonese Republic contained in document GC(53)/INF/10. The Committee had recommended that GabonÂs right to vote be restored during the current session of the Conference and until the end of the payment plan it had entered into in 2008, on the understanding that it continued to meet the requirements of the payment plan and that the Secretariat would report annually on the status of the payment plan. She took it that the Conference accepted that recommendation of the General Committee. 

101. It was so decided. 

102. The Committee had also discussed the issue of time limitations on statements in the general debate and efforts to ensure respect for the decision of the General Conference of 1998 (GC(42)/DEC/13). Accordingly, as of the 2010 session, the red light indicating that the allotted 15 minutes had elapsed would be made visible to the Plenary. 

27. Examination of delegatesÂ credentials 
(GC(53)/31) 

103. The PRESIDENT said that the General Committee had met earlier in the day to examine the credentials of all delegates, as provided for in Rule 28 of the Rules of Procedure. Since that meeting the Secretariat had received credentials in due form for Burkina Faso, Qatar and the Philippines. After discussion, the Committee had recommended the adoption by the Conference of the draft resolution contained in paragraph 7 of its report contained in document GC(53)/31, with the reservations and positions expressed therein. 

104. Mr ALIABADI (Islamic Republic of Iran) said that IranÂs acceptance of the General CommitteeÂs report in no way implied its recognition of the Israeli regime. 

105. Mr GAMIL (Egypt) said that EgyptÂs acceptance of the General CommitteeÂs report did not imply recognition that the borders of Israel included the Arab territories occupied by that country after 4 June 1967, including Arab Jerusalem, the Golan Heights and the Shebaa Farms. 

106. Ms HATTAR (Jordan) said that JordanÂs acceptance of the credentials submitted by the Israeli delegation should on no account be understood as including the territories occupied since 1967, in particular Jerusalem and the Golan Heights. For Jordan, Israel did not extend beyond the borders of 4 June 1967, as well as the borders stipulated in the agreement which Israel had concluded with Jordan and Egypt. 

107. The PRESIDENT took it that the General Conference was prepared to adopt the draft resolution contained in paragraph 7 of document GC(53)/31. 


 
108. 	It was so decided. 	   
Â 	Report of the Scientific Forum 	   
109. 	The PRESIDENT recalled that the theme of the Scientific Forum for 2009 had been ÂEnergy for 	 

DevelopmentÂ. She invited Dr Srikumar Banerjee, the Chairman of the Scientific Forum, to present his report. 

110. Mr BANERJEE (Chairman of the Scientific Forum) presented the report, which is reproduced in the Annex. 

111. The PRESIDENT thanked Mr Banerjee for his most interesting report on the work and outcome of the Scientific Forum, and the Secretariat for its excellent preparation of the Scientific Forum. 

12. 	Appointment of the External Auditor 
(GC(53)/27) 

112. The PRESIDENT said that the tenure of the AgencyÂs current External Auditor would end with the completion of the audit of the AgencyÂs accounts for the financial year 2009. It would therefore be necessary to appoint an External Auditor to audit the AgencyÂs accounts for the financial years 2010 and 2011. The matter had been considered by the Board in June, but it had not been in a position to make a recommendation to the Conference. 

113. Mr MALHOTRA (India) said that his country had proposed the Comptroller and Auditor General of India as a candidate for the post of External Auditor of the Agency for the period 2010Â 2011, as indicated in document GC(53)/27. However, the German Government had requested a fourth term for the German Supreme Audit Institution. The practice in the Agency had been three terms, and occasionally four, for each External Auditor. In keeping with the Âspirit of ViennaÂ, India had decided not to press its candidature at the current General Conference in order to avoid an election. It trusted that its patience would be rewarded at the 55th regular session of the General Conference in 2011. 

114. The PRESIDENT took it that the Conference wished to appoint the Vice-President of the German Supreme Audit Institution as the External Auditor to audit the AgencyÂs accounts for the financial years 2010 and 2011. 

115. 	It was so decided. 

116. Mr LUEDEKING (Germany) thanked the Indian delegation for withdrawing its candidature and expressed appreciation to the General Conference for the confidence it had placed in the German Supreme Audit Institution. It was important at the current juncture for the Institution to continue its planned audit in 2010 and 2011. Germany had already made it clear that it would not be putting forward a candidate thereafter. 

8. 	General debate and Annual Report for 2008 (resumed) (GC(53)/7) 

117. Ms MOUSSA (Niger) said that her country, as a uranium producer, was totally committed to the AgencyÂs objectives, strove to prevent the use of nuclear energy for military purposes and ensure that nuclear energy for peaceful purposes was used in the safest possible way, and actively promoted the peaceful use of nuclear techniques and strengthening of the related international legal framework. It was committed to working closely with the Secretariat and all Member States in the interests of peace, security and prosperity. 
118. Recognizing the importance of non-proliferation, nuclear safety and security, and radiation protection, Niger cooperated closely with the Agency and had received ISSAS, IRRS and INSServ missions. It hoped that the implementation of the recommendations from those missions would help the country achieve national and international non-proliferation and radiation protection objectives, and refine its regulatory framework for nuclear safety and security. 
119. Niger commended the AgencyÂs activities in the field of human health, in particular cancer control, and in the field of agriculture, stockbreeding, water resources management, environment and energy. Her country was pleased at the results achieved in the various technical cooperation programmes it was developing with the Agency. 
120. As part of its policy of improving the national health system, Niger was working with the Agency and other development partners on a programme to combat cancer, the prevalence of which was growing. The Government was investing a lot of effort in the construction of a radiotherapy centre and in the provision of technical resources for treating cancer patients. 
121. Niger was currently experiencing a resurgence in activities related to mining. With the establishment of two new uranium mining companies, Niger was set to become the second largest uranium producer in the world by 2012. The country was committed to developing its mining sector with respect for human health and the environment. Thus, it attached particular importance to the AgencyÂs activities on radiation safety, management of radioactive mining waste, and dosimetry, particularly internal exposure monitoring. 
122. Her Government planned to end the countryÂs energy dependence by introducing a nuclear power programme to produce enough electricity to meet the increased demand in Niger and the subregion. 
123. Niger needed to revitalize its agricultural and stockbreeding sectors, which employed more than 80% of the working population, and thus it highly valued the AgencyÂs technical cooperation programmes aimed at increasing agricultural and animal production. The use of nuclear techniques in those fields could contribute significantly to addressing the development challenges of food security, combating poverty and environmental management, in particular pesticide use. Niger was also hoping to apply isotopic techniques to study the silting up of the River Niger. 
124. The country also welcomed Agency assistance through regional and subregional programmes and intended to participate actively in the AFRA programme. 
125. Lastly, she expressed the hope that the CPF that was currently being finalized would be appropriately implemented, leading to beneficial technical cooperation projects. 
The meeting rose at 12.55 p.m. 
Report to the 53rd Regular Session of the IAEA General Conference 
th 
from the 12Scientific Forum 
17 September 2009 
Forum Chair: Dr Srikumar Banerjee Director of the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre, India 
Madam President, Director General, Distinguished Delegates 
Without energy there is no development. For every aspect of development we need energy, be it nutrition, health care, education or the production of goods and services. 
However, 1.6 billion people or one fourth of world population have no access to modern energy services provided by electricity. Although energy is not explicitly included among the Millennium Development Goals, there was general agreement that eradicating energy poverty is an essential prerequisite for achieving them. This will require working towards bold targets for access to modern energy services for all by 2030. 
The Forum first identified key factors that hamper efforts to effectively tackle energy poverty. At the international level, work on energy is fragmented. The Director General proposes that this should be alleviated by establishing a global energy organization to focus on, among other possibilities: energy planning, technology transfer, R&D on technologies serving the energy needs of the poor and energy supplies in crisis situations. These international arrangements should be complemented by support to local energy initiatives based on local skills, technologies and material. 
An important issue for framing the energy predicament is climate change. The responsibility of reducing greenhouse gas emissions has to be shared by everybody. Developing countries are most vulnerable and their best defence against the impacts of climate change will be development. Their contribution to greenhouse gas reductions is important for a successful global climate policy, but the financial burden should be carried by developed countries. This will require at least three internationally coordinated tasks: mobilizing contributions from developed countries, arranging distribution among developing countries and then channelling the resources and monitoring accountability. The estimated requirement would be on the order of 1% of GDP of developed countries. 
After identifying the energy-related impediments to development, the forum addressed the drivers shaping future energy demand, recognizing that it is energy services not energy or fuel per se that societies need for development. Demographic change -growth or decline, ageing population, shifting household sizes Â and migration are key factors affecting the quantity and mix of energy services. While international development has traditionally focussed on energy poverty in rural areas, ongoing urbanization and access to urban amenities in rural areas are expected to broaden the challenge of providing energy access for all. 
Another important driver of energy demand is infrastructure. Many developing countries are in the process of establishing or expanding their basic infrastructure (from settlement patterns and transportation infrastructure to buildings and industrial production facilities). Establishing infrastructures is an energy-intensive process in itself, and because of its longevity, its operation will considerably affect energy demand for decades to come. Hence, there is a chance and need for public policy to build the ÂrightÂ infrastructure for development. Energy efficiency, especially at the level of energy end use, is a crucial factor for effective development. Pursuing energy efficiency has many benefits, ranging from the possibility to improve access to energy, enhance energy security and reduce reliance on imports to economic gains (like improving returns on rural investments) and health and education benefits. 
The steadily growing demand for energy, as projected by the International Energy Agency, for example, will require huge investments, but enticing private capital will require institutional improvements, like reforms in the power sector. If done well, such reforms can improve the performance, service quality and thus the affordability of electricity for the poor, but in addition to the energy sector reforms, complementary measures are often needed, for example incentive schemes, subsidies or regulatory mandates to warrant equity. Energy production and use involve many negative environmental and social impacts called externalities. The external costs need to be assessed so that they can be incorporated in prices by adequate regulation, for example through pollution taxes or tradable permits. Despite pervasive uncertainties, the scientific basis for assessing energy-related externalities is wellÂ­established but social aspects, especially ethical considerations, remain controversial. 
Even with an accelerated implementation of energy efficiency, low energy-intensive infrastructures and life style changes, global energy demand is set to rise, especially when the currently 1.6 billion unconnected people begin to enjoy modern energy services. 
After demand, the deliberations turned to energy supply. Though in the next few decades the world will not be running out of any of the energy resources, time has come to plan for an optimized use of energy resources to achieve a long-term sustainability. With fossil fuel reserve being depleted and with the pressing need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, we must increase the share of nuclear and renewable energy in the worldÂs energy mix. Fossil and fissile energy resources in the earthÂs crust are sufficient for providing energy for a few centuries. But utilization of these resources for providing energy services to all requires timely investments in exploration, mining and energy production capacities. 
Despite several advantages of renewable energy, namely, energy security and reduced price volatility, for example, only a small portion of their technical potential is now used due to intermittency, large space requirements and other challenges. Funding is needed for research and development (R&D) to improve the technologies for harnessing renewable energy sources and innovative financing arrangements are required to increase their contribution to the energy mix. 
Fossil fuels will continue to provide the largest share of global energy needs in the next few decades. The main benefits of cleaner fossil technologies, especially complemented with carbon capture and storage (CCS) include stretching the available energy reserves, keeping fossil fuels in the energy mix and thereby increasing energy security and reducing local air pollution and greenhouse gas emission. Nuclear energy has a good prospect for playing a larger role in the global energy supply due to progress being made on safety, economics, waste management and proliferation resistance in the current and future reactor technologies and fuel cycles. Biofuels might also become an increasingly important element of energy supply but thorough assessments and policies will be required to avoid conflicts with food security targets due to increasing competition for land and the associated higher agricultural prices. 
Key areas for technology development and innovation on the supply side include, but are not limited to 
The adoption of closed nuclear fuel cycles and thorium utilization for full utilization of fissile and fertile nuclear materials; 
The development of suitable technologies for managing CO2 from fossil fuel and for nuclear waste; and 
Further development of renewable technologies. 

The Scientific Forum closed with several variations on the DGÂs opening proposal for a new global energy organization. UNIDO Director General Kandeh Yumkella suggested several immediate fora to advance the idea and to discuss specific mechanisms, including an expanded role of UN-Energy, the use of the Vienna based international energy organizations as an international hub, and building on the 2009 Vienna International Energy Conference. 
AndrÃ© Mernier, Secretary General of the Energy Charter Treaty (ECT), reported on prospective new Charter members from the Middle East and suggested further extension to Africa to help aggregate small markets and establish norms attractive to investors. A proposal for a global energy agency focussed on oil and gas to contain oil market price volatility within negotiated band widths was also discussed. 
In summary, there was a general consensus that crafting robust national energy strategies is a prerequisite for reducing energy poverty and charting sustainable energy development. The planning tools and capacity building provided by IAEA are an important contribution towards this objective but much more is needed. The session concluded that there was indeed a need for an International Energy Organization that would address development-energy challenges by searching for technology solutions, elaborating policy frameworks and monitoring implementation. An important task would be fostering relevant international treaties that bring together resource rich and resource poor, developing and developed countries.

9. Election of members to the Board of Governors 
(GC(53)/8 and 25) 

1. The PRESIDENT recalled that in 1989 the General Conference had approved a procedure whereby, when there was agreement regarding the candidate or candidates from a particular area, no secret ballot would be held provided that there was no objection; balloting would take place only for those areas where no candidate had been agreed upon. That procedure considerably facilitated the rational use of the General ConferenceÂs time. If it was agreeable to the Conference, she would proceed with the election of members to the Board of Governors in the manner outlined. 
2. It was so decided. 
3. The PRESIDENT drew attention to document GC(53)/8 containing a list of the Agency Member States designated to serve on the Board from the end of the current session of the Conference until the end of the 54th (2010) session. She recalled that, under Rule 83 of the Rules of Procedure, she had to inform the General Conference of the elective places on the Board that had to be filled. To that end, document GC(53)/25 had been prepared; it indicated that the Conference had to elect eleven members of the Board from the seven categories listed. 
4. Agreement had been reached on the candidates for the vacancies to be filled in all area groups with the exception of Africa, where more than one candidate was listed for one vacancy to be filled. Accordingly, a secret ballot would have to be held in order to fill one vacancy in that area. 
5. She took it that the General Conference wished to elect Peru and Venezuela to the two vacant seats for Latin America. 
6. Peru and Venezuela were duly elected. 
7. The PRESIDENT took it that the General Conference wished to elect Denmark and the Netherlands to the two vacant seats for Western Europe. 
8. Denmark and the Netherlands were duly elected. 
9. The PRESIDENT took it that the General Conference wished to elect Azerbaijan and Ukraine to the two vacant seats for Eastern Europe. 
10. Azerbaijan and Ukraine were duly elected. 
11. The PRESIDENT took it that the General Conference wished to elect Pakistan to the one vacant seat for the Middle East and South Asia. 
12. Pakistan was duly elected. 
13. The PRESIDENT took it that the General Conference wished to elect Mongolia to the one vacant seat for the Far East. 
14. Mongolia was duly elected. 
15. The PRESIDENT took it that the General Conference wished to elect the Republic of Korea to the floating seat for the Far East/MESA/SEAP, which it was the turn of a member from SEAP to fill. 
16. The Republic of Korea was duly elected. 
17. The PRESIDENT noted that there were two vacant seats to be filled for Africa. There appeared to be agreement on one of those vacant seats but not on the second and, consequently, the Conference would have to hold a ballot to fill the second vacant seat. 
18. She took it that, for one of the vacant seats for Africa, the General Conference wished to elect Kenya. 
19. 	Kenya was duly elected. 
20. The PRESIDENT invited the General Conference to proceed to a vote by secret ballot for the remaining vacant seat for Africa. 
21. 	A vote was taken by secret ballot. 
22. At the invitation of the President, Mr Brady (Ireland) and Ms Rivera (Philippines) acted as tellers. 
23. The PRESIDENT, noting that the counting of votes would take some time, suggested that the General Conference should resume the general debate until the results could be announced. 
8. 	General debate and Annual Report for 2008 (resumed) (GC(53)/7) 

24. Ms ÂIAKOVÃ (Slovakia) said that nuclear energy made an important contribution to meeting energy needs worldwide and particularly in Slovakia, where almost 50% of electricity was produced in nuclear power plants. Under the countryÂs energy strategy, nuclear energy would remain an important energy source in the long term. The shutdown of the second unit of the Bohunice V-1 nuclear power plant at the end of 2008 posed an increased challenge to the security of energy supply, but significant steps had been taken by her Government and the energy sector to find appropriate ways of offsetting the resulting shortfall in electricity production. Units 3 and 4 of the Mochovce nuclear power plant were expected to come into operation in 2012 and 2013 respectively, which would be a major step forward. 

25. In December 2008, the Slovakian Government had approved an initiative for the construction of a new unit at the Bohunice site to provide for the expected medium-term increase in energy consumption and, in that connection, she expressed appreciation for Agency activities to support Member States introducing or expanding nuclear energy for power generation. In such activities, particular attention should be accorded by the Agency to safety, security and waste management. The fifth meeting of the European Nuclear Energy Forum would be taking place in Bratislava in May 2010. 

26. Slovakia used nuclear energy exclusively for peaceful purposes and paid the closest attention to safety and security. Based on operational performance, regulatory assessments and inspection results, its independent Nuclear Regulatory Authority considered the operation of all nuclear installations in the country to be safe, reliable and within the national legal framework. 

27. At the 3rd review meeting of the Contracting Parties to the Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management held in Vienna in May 2009, SlovakiaÂs national report had been widely discussed and its comprehensiveness and transparency had been commended by several Contracting Parties. The review meeting had concluded 
that the safety of nuclear installations and the legal and regulatory framework were in line with international best practice. The Agency should promote adherence to international instruments such as the Convention on Nuclear Safety and the Joint Convention. 
28. Safety was a precondition for all applications of nuclear energy and it was essential that the Agency support that objective and make its services available to Member States. The Slovak authorities considered the AgencyÂs expert services an essential part of international cooperation and a confidence-building measure to support national regulatory decision-making processes. 

29. European Council Directive 2009/71/Euratom of 25 June 2009 establishing a Community framework for the nuclear safety of nuclear installations was the first legally binding European Union document in the nuclear safety area. Member States were obliged to ensure proper transposition of the Directive into national legislation and Slovakia had already begun preparatory work in that regard. 

30. In the field of improving the security of nuclear material and nuclear facilities, the Slovakian Government was preparing a law to protect national critical infrastructure, including the nuclear power sector. The working group established to address that task comprised experts from various ministries and other governmental bodies under the auspices of the Ministry of the Interior. The main features of the law related to the financing of protection systems and implementation of the relevant European Union Directive. 

31. Technical cooperation with the Agency remained an important part of SlovakiaÂs international cooperation activities. Her country had been cooperating with the Agency on a wide range of national, regional and interregional projects, and technical cooperation under the auspices of the Agency had contributed in the medium term to the development of peaceful uses of nuclear energy in the Europe region. During 2009, Member States in the Europe region had been working on a strategy for regional technical cooperation with the aim of improving its effectiveness and efficiency and reflecting new trends and realities worldwide. The objectives of the strategy were to ensure the relevance and impact of the programme, to promote inclusive participation of Member States, to strengthen partnerships, to ensure effective governance of the programme, and to promote optimal use of financial and human resources. The strategy should be complete by the end of the year. The regional strategies currently being elaborated could be used as a basis for preparing an overall medium-term strategy for technical cooperation. 

32. As in previous years, Slovakia stood ready to continue making experts and training facilities available and would maintain its general policy of accepting fellows and scientific visitors sponsored by the Agency. The country was committed to fulfilling its financial obligations to the Agency, including its contribution to technical cooperation activities, and would continue to support the Agency fully. 

33. Mr STRITAR (Slovenia) said that the AgencyÂs role in preventing the misuse of nuclear material was widely recognized and its ultimate goal was to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons. The Agency had more than fifty yearsÂ experience of impartial and independent verification activities. Eighty-four States had comprehensive safeguards agreements and additional protocols in force, which should be considered the contemporary verification standard, and his country urged all other Member States to adopt that standard without delay. Slovenia, as one of the countries in which integrated safeguards were being implemented, supported progress in strengthening the effectiveness and improving the efficiency of the AgencyÂs safeguards system. 

34. The threat of nuclear or other radioactive material being used in malicious acts remained high and should be addressed in a timely manner in order to minimize potential consequences to society and the environment. The AgencyÂs work in the area of nuclear security was indispensable to prevent, detect and respond to nuclear terrorism, and it was pleasing that almost 90% of Member States that 
had responded to the November 2007 evaluation of the nuclear security programme had been satisfied with the AgencyÂs work. Nevertheless, the responsibility for nuclear security rested with Member States, which should work hand in hand with the Agency to strengthen non-proliferation, nuclear verification and export controls. In that connection, Slovenia had ratified the amended CPPNM. 
35. His country attached great importance and was fully committed to supporting the AgencyÂs technical cooperation activities. It had hosted Agency regional workshops, training courses and seminars in the preceding year and Slovenian organizations and institutions had trained Agency fellows from various developing countries. Since 2006, Slovenian experts had been active in assisting Serbia with the decommissioning of nuclear facilities. Slovenian assistance had been given mainly to the Serbian regulatory authority, which needed to issue a licence for the repackaging and transport of spent fuel from the Vin?a research reactor. In 2009, the assistance provided had comprised on-site visits, a workshop in Ljubljana, review of the final safety analysis report, drafting of licensing conditions, and consultations on transport of spent fuel to Russia. 

36. Slovenia recognized the efforts made by the Secretariat to improve and strengthen emergency preparedness and response in Member States. The AgencyÂs Incident and Emergency Centre maintained the Joint Radiation Emergency Management Plan of the International Organizations and acted as the focal point for international preparedness, communication and response to nuclear and radiological incidents. Slovenian organizations participated in the Response Assistance Network, under which Member States party to the emergency conventions and relevant international organizations were able to register their response capabilities. He welcomed the networkÂs increasing popularity among Member States, which sent a clear message that no country should be left alone in the event of an emergency. Exercises were an important tool to test emergency response capability and the ConvEx exercises were widely appreciated by Member States. Slovenia successfully participated in such activities, which ranged from simple communication and response tests to the full operation of the worldwide information exchange mechanism. In the light of emerging security threats, those exercises should also include a security component. 

37. SloveniaÂs system for preventing illicit trafficking of radioactive material in scrap metal had been significantly improved in 2008 to strengthen national control over orphan sources, which could be present in any shipment from domestic suppliers or from abroad. During 2008, 86 000 shipments had been monitored by scrap metal importers and metal reprocessing plants. Two findings involving radioactive sources had occurred at scrap yards, but there had been no events posing a threat to workers or the population. 

38. For the time being, SloveniaÂs main goals related to the continued safe operation of existing nuclear capacities. Since 2005, there had been no automatic or manual reactor trips at the KrÂko nuclear power plant. The programme for the next periodic safety review at the plant, due to be complete in 2013, had been submitted to the regulator. An ageing management programme had been completed and life-extension activities ranked high on the operatorÂs agenda. International experience and information exchange could significantly contribute to maintaining high levels of nuclear safety. The KrÂko nuclear power plant had an excellent operating record, maintaining its share of almost 40% of electrical power supplied to the national grid despite the overall increase in production, including from hydroelectric and thermal power, in recent years. 

39. With the phasing out of older thermal power plants over the coming decade, it was expected that new units would be added to the Slovenian fleet of power plants. A new nuclear power plant was still considered to be a possible solution, although other energy options were competing to provide the power that would be needed in the near future. The advantages of nuclear energy were numerous and included reliability, large units, low operational costs and negligible greenhouse gas emissions, although the disadvantages were large initial investment and the long and complicated licensing and 
construction phase. Nevertheless, nuclear power remained a viable option for SloveniaÂs current and future energy mix. With the development of new and safer nuclear power plant designs, nuclear energy would be even more attractive. Slovenian nuclear-related organizations were seriously considering that option. 
40. The process of identifying a site for a repository for low-and intermediate-level radioactive waste would soon be completed. A major step had occurred in July 2009 when the KrÂko municipal council had approved an amendment to the national plan to locate the repository at Vrbina, after long public debate. Once the plan for the repository had been adopted by the Government, an application for construction could be filed. 

41. Slovenia attached the utmost importance to high levels of nuclear safety worldwide. The Convention on Nuclear Safety and the Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management were recognized as incentive conventions, and the review process under those instruments helped maintain a high level of nuclear safety. An analysis of issues relating to the Convention on Nuclear Safety had revealed that many appeared to be countryÂ­specific. Following the 4th review meeting of the Contracting Parties to the Convention on Nuclear Safety, the time had come to introduce changes to make the review process more efficient. Slovenia welcomed the forthcoming first extraordinary meeting of the Contracting Parties and hoped that the proposed rule changes would meet PartiesÂ expectations. He highlighted the importance of continuous safety improvement and promoting international cooperation on safety matters, including outside the framework of the aforementioned conventions. In addition, bilateral relations could be used to exchange information, which could resolve many safety-related issues in countries with less operating experience. 

42. Drawing attention to the widespread use of radiation techniques in medicine, he noted that advances in medical imaging and therapy equipment had resulted in better treatment methods for patients, but radiation protection could not be neglected. UNSCEAR estimated that the dose to the world population due to medical diagnostic procedures had risen by more than 70% in less than a decade. Medical radiation techniques offered benefits, but medical exposure had to be justified and optimized. Exchange of information and experience among practitioners should be encouraged, in addition to strengthening regulatory oversight of patient exposure.

8. 	General debate and Annual Report for 2008 (resumed) (GC(53)/7) 

46. Mr HORVATIC (Croatia) said that the Agency was the worldÂs focal point for peaceful nuclear cooperation and nuclear safety and it had an indispensable role in preventing the spread of nuclear weapons, especially since Member States had been facing new security challenges and threats, nuclear terrorism foremost among them. The three pillars of the AgencyÂs activities Â verification, safety and technology Â had retained their validity for the past 53 years and they were equally important and interdependent. 

47. Croatia supported international initiatives on non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and the peaceful use of nuclear technology. It had actively participated in the adoption of the International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism, the Code of Conduct on the Safety and Security of Radioactive Sources and the amended CPPNM. It was monitoring the ratification process for the amended CPPNM with keen interest and was looking forward to the required two-thirds majority of State Parties being achieved. At national level, Croatia had established institutional capacities for the prevention of illicit trafficking in nuclear and other radioactive material. In addition, in 2009, it had participated in the 3rd review meeting of the Contracting Parties to the Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management and had successfully presented its third national report. 

48. His country had been one of the first Member States to sign and ratify an additional protocol and it had also brought into force a revised SQP. He called on all States that had not yet done so to sign, ratify and implement an additional protocol without delay. He also called on all States with SQPs to conclude an exchange of letters with the Agency to give effect to the standardized text and modified criteria. Croatia was implementing integrated safeguards and all nuclear material in Croatia remained in peaceful activities. 

49. One of the most important aspects of collaboration between Croatia and the Agency was technical cooperation. The AgencyÂs development role, as a focal point for peaceful nuclear cooperation, should not be underestimated. He expressed his countryÂs gratitude for the assistance provided by the Agency through a wide range of ongoing technical cooperation projects and research agreements, which had made a positive impact in various fields of the peaceful use of nuclear energy and techniques. 

50. In the 2009Â2011 project cycle, five national projects were being implemented, covering applications of radiation in medicine, improvement of nuclear and radiation safety infrastructure, and 
implementation of nuclear techniques in environmental protection, based on the priorities set out in the countryÂs current CPF. Croatia hoped that a revised CPF would be finalized soon, taking into account CroatiaÂs new energy strategy. 
51. His country extended its full support to the AgencyÂs activities to enhance regional cooperation and exchange of knowledge through regional projects. It actively participated in regional projects either as a lead country, or through the organization of meetings and workshops in research and other relevant institutions in Croatia. A large and growing number of foreign experts were being trained in CroatiaÂs institutions under the AgencyÂs fellowship programme. The Member States of the Europe region recognized regional cooperation as the best mechanism to promote effective and open exchange of know-how and experience and they were moving towards the preparation of a strategy for technical cooperation, which Croatia supported strongly. 

52. For many years, Member States had been discussing and negotiating every budget proposal for very lengthy periods. Budgetary issues were of particular importance in the light of the global financial crisis. As the Director General had repeatedly emphasized, without adequate funding the Agency would be unable to fulfil its statutory tasks. He drew attention to the importance of StatesÂ budgetary commitments and obligations and stressed that Croatia had continued to fulfil its own obligations and expected all Member States to do the same, for their common benefit, security and prosperity. 

53. Mr ELWAZER (Palestine) emphasized the importance of the AgencyÂs support for peaceful uses of nuclear energy in areas such as medicine, industry, research, power generation and water desalination. The technical cooperation programme had boosted international confidence in the role of nuclear technology in vital areas of everyday life. Other important Agency activities included the application of safeguards and promotion of nuclear-weapon-free zones. 

54. Palestine strongly urged all States that had not yet signed a safeguards agreement and had not acceded to the NPT, especially Israel, to do so forthwith. It also called on all nuclear-weapon States to disarm in the interests of the survival and well-being of humankind. IsraelÂs refusal to accede to the safeguards regime and sign the NPT posed a threat to regional and international peace and security. 

55. The people of Palestine were directly exposed to the threat of IsraelÂs nuclear reactors. For instance, there were many reports, some written by Israelis, to the effect that the Dimona reactor had reached the end of its service life and that a variety of accidents were liable to occur. The resulting risk to the Palestinian people and land could not be ignored. He therefore urged the Agency and its Member States to make every effort to assess the status of Israeli nuclear installations, to take steps to reassure the Palestinian people and other peoples of the region, and to eliminate the existing risks. 

56. Palestine was greatly concerned over the persistent shortcomings of the AgencyÂs safeguards regime and at the lack of safeguards in States that had not acceded to the NPT. The current situation in the Middle East posed a serious threat to regional peace and security because of IsraelÂs refusal to accede to the NPT and apply safeguards, and the inability of the Agency and other States to take effective action in that regard. The situation was conducive to an arms race and escalating tension in the region. The AgencyÂs credibility depended on how it handled the issues of the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East and application of Agency safeguards to all nuclear installations in the region. 

57. Palestine strongly supported discussion of the agenda item on Israeli nuclear capabilities proposed by the Arab States with the support of other groups. IsraelÂs continued pursuit of a policy of ambiguity and its unwillingness to speak frankly about its nuclear capabilities constituted blatant defiance of the international community. He demanded that all Member States be given the opportunity to discuss the item and adopt an appropriate resolution aimed at eliminating the threat 
posed by Israeli nuclear capabilities. There would be no peace in the Middle East until the Palestinian people realized their dream of establishing an independent State with its capital in Jerusalem on the Palestinian land occupied since 1967, and until the Palestinian refugees were able to return to their homeland in accordance with relevant United Nations resolutions, in particular General Assembly resolution 194 (III). 
58. He warmly thanked the Secretariat for the support it was giving to projects relating to the development of environmental radiation monitoring, support for the production of a radiation map of Palestine, development of radiation protection services, building of national preparedness to deal with radiation and nuclear accidents, training of human resources and support for nuclear technology applications. The AgencyÂs support in those areas would make an effective contribution to the realization of the Palestinian peopleÂs dream of being able to live like other peoples in a safe and stable environment. 

59. He also thanked the Agency for its positive response to the request made by the Council of Arab Ambassadors in Vienna concerning the content of a number of reports and witness statements by specialist physicians regarding the possibility that the Israeli army had used ammunition and bombs containing depleted uranium during its attack on the Gaza Strip in late December 2008, which had claimed the lives of more than 1500 Palestinians, most of them innocent civilians, including women and children, and had injured more than 6000. The veracity of the reports was still being investigated with the assistance of the Agency, which was the sole authority capable of undertaking the necessary analyses with a view to reassuring the people of Gaza. 

60. Mr MARCUZZO DO CANTO (ABACC) said that the mission of his institution was to manage the Common System of Accounting and Control of Nuclear Materials, which involved safeguarding all nuclear facilities and material in Brazil and Argentina. He was pleased to be able to confirm that all nuclear material and other items under safeguards in the two countries had been used for exclusively peaceful purposes and recorded appropriately in 2008. 

61. All ABACC activities related to the application of safeguards were performed in conjunction with the Agency, respecting the independent conclusions of each body, and within the framework of the Quadripartite Agreement signed in 1991. Under that agreement, Brazil and Argentina had committed themselves to the application of safeguards to ensure the non-diversion of nuclear material. Coordination between the Agency and ABACC ensured effective cost management, avoided duplication of effort and promoted efficiency and effectiveness in safeguards activities. The good results obtained with regard to unannounced inspections and sharing of safeguards equipment reflected the high level of understanding and cooperation between the two institutions. 

62. An example of significant progress over the preceding year had been the successful implementation of short-notice random inspections at fuel element factories in Argentina and Brazil thanks to the efforts of officials, technicians, inspectors, consultants and laboratories in both countries, all working under the supervision and guidance of ABACCÂs Board of Directors. 

63. For several decades, cooperation between the Agency and the FAO had produced good results, with the use of nuclear technologies leading to improvements in the quantity and quality of harvests. With the global food crisis and forecasts of steep population increases, the Agency was set to play a greater role in the fields of agriculture and nutrition. 

64. The AgencyÂs responsibilities were also growing exponentially in the context of the growing interest in using nuclear power to meet increased energy needs in a way that did not produce carbon dioxide emissions. With its accumulated experience and knowledge, the Agency was regarded as an invaluable source of support and assistance for the construction of adequate, safe and reliable infrastructures in countries launching nuclear power programmes. However, more nuclear power 
plants entailed increased proliferation risks and there was a threat that belligerent nations or terrorist groups might abuse nuclear material. 
65. The AgencyÂs enhanced responsibilities meant that it needed an increased budget. The Commission of Eminent Persons had concluded that the budget should be doubled by 2020 in order to meet the new demands successfully. 

66. One way to face future challenges would be to create independent and reliable regional systems to be applied in coordination with the Agency while optimizing use of available resources. The successes of Euratom and ABACC could serve as a model. Models could not be directly applied in other regions owing to differing geopolitical characteristics and cultural differences, but the concept of developing regional agencies merited consideration. 

67. The decisions of both Argentina and Brazil to reactivate their nuclear programmes meant that an increase in ABACCÂs inspection, accounting and control activities was foreseen over the coming years. New technologies such as three-dimensional images obtained using laser rays, environmental sampling and satellite imagery could be incorporated into safeguards processes to render them more effective and less intrusive. ABACC stayed abreast of such developments and understood that officials and inspectors must receive ongoing training to keep them up to date with the latest technologies. As part of its quest for excellence, it was ABACCÂs policy to ensure that its staff and inspectors were well qualified and it therefore cooperated with the Agency, the United States Department of Energy and Euratom in areas such as non-destructive analysis, containment and surveillance, training courses and safeguards approaches. 

68. Mr GRANSER (Sovereign Order of Malta) said that the modern world was characterized by a high degree of interdependence at the economic, political, social and environmental level. It was important to mobilize resources to promote lasting peace and sustainability. His organization, as the predecessor of modern international humanitarian institutions, still actively pursued the humanitarian commitments which had inspired its founding 900 years before. It worked without religious or ideological discrimination to help the poor and suffering, preserve the fundamental values of humanity, act as a promoter of peace among nations, religions and societies, and contribute to worldwide security. 

69. The AgencyÂs work had always been marked by the so-called spirit of Vienna, which sought to unite nations in their efforts to achieve the peaceful and safe use of nuclear technology, respect for the environment and consideration for the most disadvantaged populations. His organization wished to see all States working together to promote nuclear safety and security, and a culture of life and peace capable of promoting the development of peoples. 

70. The NPT was the cornerstone of nuclear disarmament efforts and an important element in the further development of nuclear energy applications for peaceful purposes. 

71. The AgencyÂs technical cooperation programme had achieved major advances in the fields of agriculture, hydrology, food security and medicine. He encouraged the Agency to continue those activities, particularly those aimed at improving access to safe drinking water. 

72. The AgencyÂs activities showed how issues and conflicts in the world community could be governed by common regulations if all countries worked together towards the same goals. In the same spirit of joint action, his organization, through its embassies and relief organizations, gave people the chance to escape poverty, conflict and disease. He commended the significant technical contribution of the Agency to peace and security and to development activities benefiting the most marginalized peoples of the world. 

The meeting was suspended at 4.45 p.m. and resumed at 6.40 p.m. 
21. Application of IAEA safeguards in the Middle East 
(GC(53)/12, Add.1 and Corr.1; GC(53)/L.2/Rev.1) 

73. The PRESIDENT said that the item had been included on the agenda pursuant to General Conference resolution GC(52)/RES/15. Pursuant to operative paragraph 13 of that resolution, the Director General had submitted the report contained in document GC(53)/12, Add.1 and Corr.1. Also before the General Conference was document GC(53)/L.2/Rev.1 containing a draft resolution submitted by Egypt. 

74. Mr FAWZY (Egypt), introducing the draft resolution, said that it had been prepared following extensive consultations during the preceding weeks under the auspices of the President and with the participation of the United States of America, Sweden on behalf of the European Union, and Israel. Egypt had fully supported that process, displaying a high degree of flexibility and a willingness to accommodate the differing views that existed on the serious and substantive issues addressed by the resolution. 

75. He thanked all those who had contributed their time, goodwill and energy to the process. He believed that the result of all those efforts could be seen in the draft resolution which, in EgyptÂs view, reflected all views and should restore the consensus that had eluded the General Conference in recent years. He expressed particular gratitude to EgyptÂs partners from the Arab Group and NAM. 

76. Mr DANIELI (Israel) said that his delegation had striven for a resolution that would enable the General Conference to regain the consensus on the issue that had been lost three years previously. In recent weeks, Israel had engaged with Egypt with a view to arriving at an agreed text for the draft resolution. In addition, it had fully cooperated with the President, the European Union and the United States of America, offering utmost flexibility in the interests of consensus. Israel appreciated those efforts, as it did the efforts of other delegations that had supported the process, and those of Egypt. 

77. The attainment of regional peace, security and stability was the fundamental goal in the Middle East, as in other regions. IsraelÂs vision and policy was to establish the Middle East as a mutually verifiable zone free of weapons of mass destruction and their delivery systems. It had always emphasized that such a process should, through direct negotiations, begin with confidence-building measures, which should be followed by mutual recognition, reconciliation and peaceful relations. As a consequence, conventional and non-conventional arms control measures would emerge. IsraelÂs longÂ­term goals for regional security and arms control had been approved by its Government. 

78. As the international community had accepted and recognized in other regions, any move to establish in a region a zone free of weapons of mass destruction could only emanate from within the region itself. In IsraelÂs view, progress towards the vision of such a zone could not be made without a fundamental change in regional circumstances, including a significant transformation of the attitude of some States in the region towards Israel. IsraelÂs gradual approach towards the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East was in line with experience of similar processes in other regions, including Latin America, the South Pacific, South East Asia and Africa. 

79. Israel questioned the statements and activities of some of its neighbours, which it viewed not only as being discordant with the responsibility and mission of the Agency, but also as undermining the confidence building that was instrumental to regional security and arms control measures. NonÂ­compliance with and violations of international commitments and obligations in the nuclear domain characterized the Middle East more than any other region: four out of five recognized cases of violations of legally-binding NPT obligations over the preceding 50 years had taken place in the Middle East. Israel attached great importance to the nuclear non-proliferation regime and had supported, wherever possible, adherence to arms control and other international treaties. Universal 
adherence to the NPT was evidently no remedy in the context of such regional circumstances. His country hoped that in future a new balance could be found that would truly benefit the Middle East region as a whole. 
80. Finally, under Rule 72 of the Rules of Procedure, he requested a separate vote on operative paragraph 2 of the draft resolution. 

81. Mr FAWZY (Egypt), speaking on behalf of NAM, thanked the Director General for his report and drew attention to paragraph 123 of the final document of the 15th NAM Summit held in Sharm El Sheikh in July 2009, which stated the following: 

ÂThe Heads of State and Government reiterated their support for the establishment in the Middle East of a zone free of all weapons of mass destruction. As a priority step to this end, they reaffirmed the need for the speedy establishment of a NWFZ in the Middle East in accordance with the Security Council Resolution 487 (1981) and paragraph 14 of the Security Council Resolution 687 (1991) and the relevant General Assembly resolutions adopted by consensus. They called upon all parties concerned to take urgent and practical steps towards the fulfilment of the proposal initiated by Iran in 1974 for the establishment of such a zone and, pending its establishment, they demanded on Israel, the only country in the region that has not joined the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) nor declared its intention to do so, to renounce possession of nuclear weapons, to accede to the NPT without delay, to place promptly all its nuclear facilities under IAEA full-scope safeguards according to Security Council Resolution 487 (1981) and to conduct its nuclear related activities in conformity with the non-proliferation regime. They called for the earliest implementation of relevant IAEA resolutions on ÂApplication of IAEA Safeguards in the Middle EastÂ. They expressed great concern over the acquisition of nuclear capability by Israel which poses a serious and continuing threat to the security of neighbouring and other States, and condemned Israel for continuing to develop and stockpile nuclear arsenals. In this context they also condemned the statement made by the Prime Minister of Israel on 11 December 2006, related to the possession of nuclear weapons by Israel. They urged the continued consideration of the issue of Israeli nuclear capabilities in the context of the IAEA, including at the General Conference at its 53rd Session. They were of the view that stability cannot be achieved in a region where massive imbalances in military capabilities are maintained particularly through the possession of nuclear weapons, which allow one party to threaten its neighbours, and the region. They further welcomed the initiative by H.E. Mr Mohammed Hosni Mubarak, President of the Arab Republic of Egypt, on the establishment of a zone free from weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East, and in this context, they took into consideration the draft resolution tabled by the Syrian Arab Republic, on behalf of the Arab Group, before the Security Council on 29 December 2003 on the establishment of a zone free of all weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East. They stressed that necessary steps should be taken in different international fora for the establishment of this zone. They also called for the total and complete prohibition of the transfer of all nuclear-related equipment, information, material and facilities, resources or devices and the extension of assistance in the nuclear related scientific or technological fields to Israel. In this regard, they expressed their serious concern over the continuing development whereby Israeli scientists are provided access to the nuclear facilities of one NWS. This development will have potentially serious negative implications on security in the region as well as the reliability of the global non-proliferation regime.Â 

82. NAM noted with regret the Director GeneralÂs statement that he remained unable to make further progress in fulfilling his mandate pursuant to resolution GC(52)/RES/15 regarding the application of comprehensive Agency safeguards in the Middle East. It noted that the Director General 
would continue with his consultations in accordance with his mandate regarding the early application of comprehensive Agency safeguards on all nuclear activities in the Middle East region. 
83. NAM also regretted IsraelÂs continued insistence that progress in that regard be made contingent on other developments related to the achievement of peace in the Middle East. 

84. NAM welcomed the Director GeneralÂs finding that there was a continuing consensus that the global nuclear non-proliferation regime would be further strengthened through the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East, and it held the view that every effort should therefore be made to translate that consensus into urgent and practical steps. 

85. Furthermore, NAM took note of the recent efforts of the Director General aimed at developing the agenda and modalities for a forum on the relevance of the experience of existing nuclear-weaponÂ­free zones to establishing such a zone in the Middle East. In that connection, NAM stressed that, for that forum to be successful, its agenda should reflect the consensus within the international community on the importance of establishing a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East. NAM requested the Director General to continue consultations with Member States of the Middle East in an effort to achieve consensus on the agenda and modalities for the forum. 

86. NAM endorsed the draft resolution put forward by Egypt under the current item. 

87. Speaking on behalf of his own country, he requested that the vote requested by Israel be conducted by roll call. 

88. The PRESIDENT invited the Conference to proceed to a roll-call vote on operative paragraph 2 of the draft resolution contained in document GC(53)/L.2/Rev.1. 

89. Sudan, having been drawn by lot by the President, was called upon to vote first. 

90. The result of the vote was as follows: 

In favour: 	Albania, Algeria, Angola, Argentina, Armenia, Australia, Austria, Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Belarus, Belgium, Botswana, Brazil, Bulgaria, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Chile, China, CÃ´te dÂIvoire, Croatia, Cuba, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Ecuador, Egypt, Estonia, Ethiopia, Finland, France, Germany, Ghana, Greece, Holy See, Hungary, Iceland, Indonesia, Islamic Republic of Iran, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kenya, Republic of Korea, Kuwait, Latvia, Lebanon, Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malaysia, Malta, Mexico, Montenegro, Morocco, Myanmar, Namibia, Netherlands, New Zealand, Niger, Norway, Oman, Pakistan, Panama, Peru, Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Qatar, Republic of Moldova, Romania, Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, Serbia, Singapore, Slovakia, Slovenia, South Africa, Spain, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Sweden, Switzerland, Syrian Arab Republic, Thailand, The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Tunisia, Turkey, Ukraine, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom, Uruguay, Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, Vietnam, Yemen, Zambia, Zimbabwe. 
Against: 	Israel. 
Abstaining: 	Canada, Georgia, India, United States of America. 

91. There were 100 votes in favour and 1 against, with 4 abstentions. The paragraph was adopted. 
92. Mr DANIELI (Israel) requested a vote on the resolution as a whole under Rule 72 of the Rules of Procedure. 
93. Mr FAWZY (Egypt) requested that the vote be conducted by roll call. 
94. The PRESIDENT invited the Conference to proceed to a roll-call vote on the draft resolution contained in document GC(53)/L.2/Rev.1. 
95. Poland, having been drawn by lot by the President, was called upon to vote first. 
96. The result of the vote was as follows: 
In favour: 	Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, Albania, Algeria, Angola, Argentina, Armenia, Australia, Austria, Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Belarus, Belgium, Botswana, Brazil, Bulgaria, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Chile, China, CÃ´te dÂIvoire, Croatia, Cuba, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Ecuador, Egypt, Estonia, Ethiopia, Finland, France, Germany, Ghana, Greece, Holy See, Hungary, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Islamic Republic of Iran, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kenya, Republic of Korea, Kuwait, Latvia, Lebanon, Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malaysia, Malta, Mexico, Montenegro, Morocco, Myanmar, Namibia, Netherlands, New Zealand, Niger, Norway, Oman, Pakistan, Panama, Peru, Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Qatar, Republic of Moldova, Romania, Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, Serbia, Singapore, Slovakia, Slovenia, South Africa, Spain, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Sweden, Switzerland, Syrian Arab Republic, Tajikistan, Thailand, The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Tunisia, Turkey, Ukraine, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom, Uruguay, Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, Vietnam, Yemen, Zambia, Zimbabwe. 
Abstaining: 	Canada, Georgia, Israel, United States of America. 

97. There were 103 votes in favour and none against, with 4 abstentions. The resolution was adopted. 
98. Mr KUMAR (India), speaking in explanation of vote, said that his delegation had abstained in the vote on operative paragraph 2 of the draft resolution because it introduced matters extraneous to the Agency. 
99. Mr OTHMAN (Syrian Arab Republic) said that, in 2003, his country had submitted a draft resolution to the Security Council on behalf of the Arab States on the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East. Unfortunately, that resolution had not been adopted. A nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East was part of confidence building and a preliminary to the establishment of peace. Israel lacked the serious political will for peace and was hindering the peace process in order to enhance its military domination in the region. The establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone required more than the wish to do so; it required the taking of practical steps, acceptance of an international resolution like the one put forward by Syria, and accession by Israel to the NPT and the placement of all its facilities under Agency comprehensive safeguards. 
100. He asked the Director General and the international community to bring pressure to bear on Israel to accede to the NPT. 
101. Mr HASTOWO (Indonesia) said that his country supported the resolution just adopted and the tasks entrusted to the Director General in it. 
102. Indonesia remained fully committed to the peace process in the Middle East and was disappointed that there had been no significant progress in efforts to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in that region. It supported the Director GeneralÂs efforts to speed up progress in that regard and to convene a forum in which participants from the Middle East and other interested parties could learn from the experience of other regions. He expressed appreciation for the agenda and modalities for such a forum presented in Annex 1 to document GC(53)/12 and expressed the hope that consultations with Member States in the Middle East would lead to a consensus in that regard. 
103. He expressed concern at the continued defiant attitude and policy of a single country in the region with regard to the placement of its nuclear installations under Agency safeguards, and at that countryÂs refusal to accede to the NPT, which impeded the achievement of peace and security. The 1995 NPT Review and Extension Conference had expressed concern about the dangerous situation in the Middle East resulting from the presence of nuclear activities in the region that were not subject to Agency safeguards. Furthermore, the 2000 NPT Review Conference had requested Israel to accede to the NPT as soon as possible. Indonesia strongly believed that the accession of Israel to the NPT and the placement of all its nuclear facilities under comprehensive Agency safeguards were the most critical steps for the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the region. It therefore urged Israel to accept the application of Agency comprehensive safeguards on all its nuclear activities and to respond positively to the demands of the international community. 
104. Mr DAVIES (United States of America) expressed appreciation for the flexible approach shown by all sides in the discussions leading up to adoption of the resolution. That approach was essential if substantive progress was to be made in the future. He offered reassurance that his countryÂs abstentions in the voting did not mean that it was any less committed to the goal of the universality of the NPT and a Middle East free of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery. 
105. Mr LUNDBORG (Sweden), speaking on behalf of the European Union, expressed satisfaction at the positive outcome of the discussions and voting on the resolution. In acting as co-Chairman Â with the United States of America Â of the negotiations on the resolution, he had been gratified by the positive atmosphere and the efforts made to find common solutions. He thanked Egypt and Israel for their constructive cooperation and expressed the hope that it could be further built upon in the future. 
The meeting rose at 7.45 p.m.
