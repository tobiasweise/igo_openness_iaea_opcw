OPENING OF THE SESSION 

1. The TEMPORARY PRESIDENT declared open the forty-fourth regular session 
of the General Conference. 
2. In accordance with Rule 48 of the Rules of Procedure of the General Conference, he 
invited delegates to observe one minute of silence dedicated to prayer or meditation. 


 All present rose and stood in silence for one minute. 

3. The TEMPORARY PRESIDENT expressed his gratitude to the Secretariat, the 
members of the General Committee and to all delegations, whose efforts during the forty-third 
session of the General Conference had greatly contributed to its success. 
4. The annual session of the General Conference provided an opportunity for Member 
States to reaffirm their commitment to using nuclear energy exclusively for economic and 
social development, and to renew their support for the Agency, especially in its predominant 
role in developing and enhancing the non-proliferation regime and promoting the peaceful 
uses of nuclear energy. 
5. One of the most important achievements of the forty-third session of the General 
Conference had been the adoption of all resolutions and decisions by consensus, most notably 
in respect of the amendment to Article VI of the Statute after almost 25 years of hard 
negotiations. It was to be hoped that that amendment would soon enter into force and that 
consensus decisions would again prevail at the present session of the General Conference. 
6. The current session was taking place only a few months after the 2000 NPT Review 
Conference, which had reaffirmed the AgencyÂs role as the organization responsible for the 
enhancement and development of the non-proliferation regime and had underlined the 
importance of the AgencyÂs activities to promote international security and the peaceful uses 
of nuclear energy. It had also emphasized the need for the Agency to be provided with 
adequate human and financial resources to enable it to carry out its mandate. 
7. In conclusion, he expressed the hope that the forty-fourth session would be a very 
successful one. 


ELECTION OF OFFICERS AND APPOINTMENT OF THE GENERAL COMMITTEE 

8. The TEMPORARY PRESIDENT invited nominations for the office of President 
of the Conference. 
9. Mr. CHIDAMBARAM (India), speaking on behalf of the Middle East and South 
Asia Group, proposed Mr. Othman (Syrian Arab Republic) for that position. 
10. Mr. Othman (Syrian Arab Republic) was elected President by acclamation. 



11. The TEMPORARY PRESIDENT congratulated Mr. Othman on his election and 
wished him every success in his task. 


 Mr. Othman (Syrian Arab Republic) took the Chair. 

12. The PRESIDENT thanked all delegations, particularly the members of the MESA 
Group, for their support and confidence in electing him as President and expressed his 
appreciation to the outgoing President, Mr. Kadri, who had presided over the previous session 
of the General Conference. 
13. Since its establishment, the Agency had carried out its activities in accordance with the 
principles and objectives of the United Nations by promoting international peace and 
co-operation. Syria had been one of the first countries to join the Agency and to sign 
international conventions concluded in pursuance of the AgencyÂs policies. Together with 
other Arab countries in West Asia, Syria was trying to establish a regional group to promote 
technical co-operation programmes and to decrease the burden on the Secretariat. 
14. It was to be hoped that at the present session of the General Conference - the first in the 
new millennium - a spirit of understanding and co-operation would prevail, enabling 
resolutions to be adopted by consensus and enabling the Agency to emerge stronger and more 
effective after the Conference. All countries had a responsibility for preserving the planetÂs 
resources, for using science for the good of mankind, and for ensuring that nuclear energy 
was used for peaceful purposes. 
15. Turning to the election of officers and appointment of the General Committee, he 
recalled that under rules 34 and 40 of its Rules of Procedure, the Conference had to elect eight 
Vice-Presidents, the Chairman of the Committee of the Whole and five additional members of 
the General Committee resulting, with himself as Chairman, in a Committee of 15. From the 
consultations that had taken place, he understood that there was a consensus on the matter and 
he therefore proposed that the delegates of Australia, Kuwait, Malta, Morocco, Peru, 
Philippines, Russian Federation and United States of America be elected as Vice-Presidents, 
that Mr. Gregoric of Slovenia be elected as Chairman of the Committee of the Whole and that 
the delegates of Canada, France, Luxembourg, Mexico and South Africa be elected as 
additional members of the General Committee. 
16. The PresidentÂs proposals were accepted. 
17. The PRESIDENT further proposed that, prior to the General CommitteeÂs 
meeting and its submission of its recommendations on the agenda, the General Conference 
waive Rule 42 of its Rules of Procedure and proceed with its consideration of items 2, 3, 4, 6 
and 7 of the provisional agenda in order not to lose time. 
18. The PresidentÂs proposal was accepted. 



APPLICATIONS FOR MEMBERSHIP OF THE AGENCY 

(GC(44)/2, 3 and 17)) 

19. The PRESIDENT drew attention to documents GC(44)/2, 3 and 17 containing 
applications for membership by Tajikistan, Azerbaijan and the Central African Republic 
respectively. All three applications had been endorsed by the Board, which had also 
submitted three draft resolutions for adoption by the General Conference. 
20. He took it that the Conference wished to adopt all three draft resolutions by 
acclamation. 
21. It was so decided. 
22. Mr. AZIMOV (Azerbaijan) thanked all delegations for supporting his countryÂs 
application for membership. The end of global confrontation and totalitarian ideology in 
Europe had created a unique opportunity to carry forward the process of disarmament and to 
unite efforts to curb the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. A number of 
remarkable achievements had already been made in that connection, and the 2000 NPT 
Review Conference had recently set another important milestone on the way to nuclear 
disarmament. The international community clearly remained convinced that the integrity and 
effective operation of the NPT, which could not have been implemented so successfully over 
the past three decades without the AgencyÂs efforts, were essential to international peace and 
security. 
23. Located at the crossroads between Europe and Asia, Azerbaijan attached great 
importance to combating the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and supported 
every effort to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the South Caucasus and to create an 
effective export control system inside the country. 
24. Despite having neither nuclear materials nor nuclear reactors, Azerbaijan was 
experiencing problems associated with the disposal of radioactive wastes, deactivation of 
contaminated areas and the training of specialists in appropriate fields. Nevertheless, its 
strong scientific potential would enable it to develop multifaceted relations with the Agency 
and it would spare no effort to contribute to the AgencyÂs activities, which were vital to 
international efforts to curb the spread of nuclear weapons. 


MESSAGE FROM THE SECRETARY-GENERAL OF THE UNITED NATIONS 

25. Mr. BJORNSSON (Representative of the Secretary-General of the 
United Nations) read out the following message: 
ÂIt gives me great pleasure to convey my warm greetings to the forty-fourth session of 
the General Conference of the International Atomic Energy Agency. The IAEA plays a 
vital role in meeting the challenges the international community has to face in the areas 
of peace and development. By preventing the proliferation of nuclear weapons, 
improving and strengthening nuclear safety, and helping to develop the peaceful uses of 





nuclear technology for sustainable development, the Agency makes a unique 
contribution to the purposes of peace and prosperity in the world. 

ÂI would like to turn first to the AgencyÂs role in seeking to prevent nuclear 
proliferation. Despite some progress in the reduction of nuclear weapons - in particular 
the Russian FederationÂs ratification of the START II agreement - there is deep concern 
within the international community at the major threat that such weapons continue to 
pose to international peace and security. The positive outcome of the 2000 Review 
Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons is 
therefore encouraging. For the first time in 15 years, States Party to the Treaty were 
able to reach a consensus on several issues crucial to the security of all the peoples of 
the world. They pledged to make new efforts aimed at the total elimination of nuclear 
arsenals, halting the global spread of nuclear weapons, and strengthening the essential 
standards governing the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. I am also pleased that at the 
Millennium Summit, just two weeks ago, world leaders have resolved to keep all 
options open for achieving the elimination of weapons of mass destruction, including 
the possibility of convening an international conference to identify ways of eliminating 
nuclear dangers. 

ÂThe Agency has played a significant role in the success of the 2000 NPT Review 
Conference. It has now an even greater role to play in verifying StatesÂ fulfilment of 
their obligations as further arms control and disarmament measures identified at the 
Conference are pursued. In this context, I welcome the AgencyÂs continuing efforts to 
strengthen and improve the nuclear safeguards system. And I would like once again to 
urge all Member States to accept the Additional Protocols to existing safeguards 
agreements as a means of further strengthening this system. 

ÂAlthough the 2000 NPT Review Conference marks a significant step forward, much 
remains to be done to free the world of nuclear dangers. The number of ratifications of 
the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty has increased during the past year, but the 
challenges that confront its entry into force persist, especially after the United States 
SenateÂs rejection of ratification in October 1999. I reiterate my call to all States to 
ratify the Treaty, particularly those whose ratification is necessary for its entry into 
force. 

ÂWe are facing yet another danger now, namely, the growing pressure to deploy 
national missile defences. Let me stress that within the scientific community, there is 
widespread scepticism that such systems could ever work effectively. There is however 
real concern that their deployment could lead to a new arms race, set back nuclear 
disarmament and non-proliferation policies, and create new incentives for missile 
proliferation. I trust that States will weigh these factors very carefully before 
embarking on a path that could jeopardize the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty and that 
may reduce, rather than enhance, global security. 

ÂNuclear safety is another area where concern is growing. One aspect which is 
particularly worrisome for the long term is radioactive waste management. I am 





pleased that the International Conference held last March in Spain on this matter has 
identified safe and publicly acceptable solutions for the management of radioactive 
waste. I expect that the Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and 
on the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management - which is now close to entering into 
force - will help to promote higher levels of nuclear safety worldwide. 

ÂI would also like to commend the efficiency of the Agency in responding rapidly to 
requests for emergency assistance, and to pay tribute to those Member States which 
repeatedly offer assistance - in the form of experts and material - in cases of a nuclear 
accident or radiological emergency. These are examples of international co-operation 
for the common good. But there is another area where greater international 
co-operation is needed: the fight against illicit trafficking in nuclear materials and other 
radioactive substances. The IAEA and the international community must urgently 
address this very real threat to global security and public health. 

ÂSafety is also very important when it comes to the transfer of nuclear technology to 
developing countries for peaceful purposes and sustainable development. Given the 
substantial contribution of nuclear techniques in areas as varied as food production and 
agriculture, human health, the management of fresh water resources and the control of 
industrial pollution, the AgencyÂs technical co-operation programme should be 
strengthened and given all the support it needs. 

ÂFinally, let me stress that in todayÂs world, we cannot rely only on governments and 
international organizations for solving national and international problems, and 
achieving our common objectives of peace and prosperity. We must work in 
partnership with non States actors. I encourage the IAEA to continue its efforts to 
increase public awareness and strengthen its relationship with civil society and the 
public sector. 

ÂI wish you a very successful conference and I look forward to co-operating closely 
with the IAEA on the important issues you are going to examine during this session.Â 




STATEMENT BY THE DIRECTOR GENERAL 

26. The DIRECTOR GENERAL said that the Millennium Summit of the United 
Nations had identified a number of major challenges facing humanity, including the efforts of 
the international community to achieve Âfreedom from fearÂ and Âfreedom from wantÂ. The 
AgencyÂs three major functions - as a catalyst for the development and transfer of nuclear 
technology; as a recognized authority on nuclear safety; and as an instrument for the 
verification of nuclear non-proliferation - were closely linked with such efforts. 
27. Nuclear technologies, in both power and non-power applications, provided the 
preferred, and sometimes only, solutions to many economic and social dilemmas and they 
held great promise for the future. 
28. Although the nuclear share of electricity was 25% or more in 17 countries, recent 
developments clearly showed that there was currently no consensus on the future role of 



nuclear power. While some countries were closing or phasing out nuclear plants, others were 
engaged in new construction or innovative research and development. In that context, he 
wished to mention an important conclusion from a report issued earlier in the year, by the 
World Energy Council (WEC Statement 2000), which related to the role of nuclear power in 
sustainable energy development. 
29. The report stated that until 2020, global reliance on fossil fuels and large hydro projects 
would remain strong; however, total reliance on those energy sources to meet the worldÂs 
growing electricity demand was not sustainable, especially in view of a projected population 
increase of two billion by 2020. The report concluded that the role of nuclear power must 
therefore be stabilized and that, in parallel, efforts to develop intrinsically safe and affordable 
nuclear technology needed to be encouraged. 
30. Significant progress was being reported with respect to the performance of nuclear 
power plants in operation. For some new plants, shorter construction periods and reduced 
operating costs were reported and, in many countries, utilities and regulators were 
co-operating on regimes for extending the operating life of existing nuclear plants. 
31. The future of nuclear energy might well depend heavily on the success in developing 
new, innovative reactors and fuel cycle designs with enhanced safety features, proliferation 
resistance, and economic competitiveness. Innovative small and medium-sized reactors were 
already under development in Argentina, China, Japan, South Africa and the Republic of 
Korea. Subject to the availability of extrabudgetary resources, the Agency planned to 
establish a task force the following year to assess future energy and technology demands and 
to identify suitable reactor and fuel cycle features. 
32. In that connection, he noted with interest the initiative of President Putin at the 
Millennium Summit, in which he called upon all countries to join an international project, 
under the auspices of the Agency, to develop new technology that could generate nuclear 
power, without requiring or producing weapons grade material and, in parallel, to focus on 
emerging technology to burn long-lived wastes from spent fuel and weapons stockpiles. The 
Agency was ready to offer its support in co-ordinating the project. 
33. The Agency had also continued to assist Member States in their energy assessment 
planning, as energy market liberalization was taking place in many developing Member 
States. The AgencyÂs previous emphasis on broad comparative assessments of energy options 
had been shifted to country-specific energy demand and supply analyses. In all its 
comparative assessment work, the objective was to provide information that was complete, 
accurate and unbiased. 
34. Probably no issue was more critical to the future of nuclear energy than the safe 
disposal of high-level radioactive waste. While experts believed geological disposal to be 
safe, technologically feasible, and environmentally responsible, the public at large remained 
sceptical, and the volume of high-level waste continued to accumulate. Some progress, 
however, was being made. Research was progressing in areas such as the transmutation of 
long-lived waste and the feasibility of retrieving wastes placed in geological repositories. A 



number of countries were engaged in deep disposal studies, and some were developing 
underground research facilities. 
35. The recent International Conference on the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management, 
held in CÃ³rdoba, Spain, had emphasized that effective national strategies for waste disposal 
would require a detailed, transparent approach, which would enable all parties to participate 
in the decision-making progress. The current yearÂs Scientific Forum was designed to build 
on the conclusions of the CÃ³rdoba Conference and to further the debate. There was also 
growing support for a global forum on nuclear waste that would invite scientists, 
policy-makers, civil society and the media to work towards forging international consensus on 
that important issue. It was his intention to establish such a forum and he would welcome 
Member StatesÂ views on the subject. 
36. Qualified, highly-trained personnel were essential to the safety of all activities related to 
nuclear technology. However, a substantial portion of the knowledge base in the nuclear 
industry was departing with retiring employees and was not being replaced. Most countries 
with advanced nuclear programmes reported a decrease in the number of new graduates in the 
nuclear field. Several countries had taken action to address the problem, including better 
funding for university programmes and co-operative efforts among industry and academia on 
research and development training, and personnel exchanges. The Agency would continue to 
focus Member StatesÂ attention on the issue. 
37. A major part of the AgencyÂs work in the technology area was in the field of nuclear 
science and applications. Some noteworthy achievements in the area included the successful 
introduction of a new palliative treatment for painful skeletal metastases of cancers, as well as 
advances in applying radioimmunoassay and isotopes to improve the diagnosis of hepatitis, 
malaria and drug-resistant tuberculosis strains. 
38. After the notable success of the project supported by the Agency in Zanzibar to 
eradicate the tsetse fly, which was widely considered to be one of the most difficult barriers to 
reducing poverty in sub-Saharan Africa, the Pan African Sterile Insect Technique Forum had 
been established to mobilize resources for an integrated, continent-wide campaign. At the 
African Summit held in July 2000, in Togo, the heads of African Member States had 
expressed their full support for the campaign, with the Agency as a principal partner. 
39. Turning to the second of the AgencyÂs three pillars, he noted that the Agency was a 
recognized, objective authority on nuclear, radiation, and waste safety and that nuclear safety 
would continue to be vital to the future of nuclear technology. 
40. In 1999, he had reported on the positive outcome of the International Conference on 
Strengthening Nuclear Safety in Eastern Europe, and was pleased to announce further 
progress with the upgrades at the nuclear power plants and fuel cycle facilities concerned. 
41. However, during the forty-third session of the General Conference, a serious criticality 
accident had occurred at Tokaimura in Japan, in which two workers had died. Since the 
accident, the Japanese Government had introduced measures to improve both operational 
safety and regulatory oversight of the entire fuel cycle. 



42. There were three major components of the international safety regime: international 
conventions, a body of internationally agreed safety standards, and mechanisms for the 
application of those standards. 
43. The Early Notification and Assistance Conventions were long established. The Agency 
received a few requests each year under the Assistance Convention. Regrettably, five people 
had died in the past year as a result of accidents involving radiation sources in Egypt and 
Thailand. Those accidents emphasized the need for decisive national and international action. 
The AgencyÂs Action Plan for the Safety of Radiation Sources and the Security of 
Radioactive Materials was making progress on strengthening the response capabilities of the 
Agency and Member States and improving education and information exchange. A group of 
experts from Member States had also prepared a Code of Conduct on the Safety and Security 
of Radioactive Sources, which the Board of Governors had requested should be circulated to 
all States and relevant international organizations. As to the Joint Convention on the Safety 
of Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management, only three 
more instruments of ratification were needed for it to enter into force, which he hoped would 
happen soon. As for the Convention on Nuclear Safety, the number of Contracting Parties 
now stood at 53, including all but two of the States with nuclear power reactors. He urged all 
States that had not already done so to become party to the Convention. 
44. The second component of the international safety regime was the body of safety 
standards. To be effective, the standards had to be comprehensive, internationally agreed 
upon and subject to regular peer review. As in the aviation field, under the auspices of the 
International Civil Aviation Organization, once agreed upon such standards should be 
uniformly applied by all States. The Secretariat was making progress on a major effort to 
update the standards, so as to ensure they represented a consensus among Member States. 
While many gaps in coverage had been identified and eliminated during the effort, some gaps 
still remained. 
45. Naturally, the desired effect on safety would be achieved only if safety standards were 
applied in practice. To assist in the application of its standards, the Agency provided 
technical assistance and co-operation, fostered information exchange, and co-ordinated 
research and development to close any remaining gaps in the system. 
46. Perhaps the best-known services were those in operational safety - in particular the 
OSART service, which continued to be in demand. Since its initiation, 107 OSART missions 
had been performed in 31 States, including in all but two States where nuclear power plants 
were in operation. As had been demonstrated by OSART follow-up missions, the rate of 
resolving operational problems and identifying inadequacies had improved in the last five 
years from 80% to 92%. 
47. Other services had been equally effective. The Agency had performed five reviews of 
plant upgrades in Ukraine, Armenia and Bulgaria in the past year, to help both the utility and 
the regulatory authorities in making technical and safety decisions. There was also still 
considerable demand for the International Regulatory Review Team service, with typical 



IRRT findings relating to the need for the greater independence of regulators, for adequate 
staffing with suitably qualified personnel, and for the requisite financial resources. 
48. More than half of all research reactors worldwide were over 35 years old, and 
two-thirds of them had been shut down without being decommissioned. Limited regulatory 
supervision, inadequate maintenance and fuel storage, and degraded or obsolete equipment 
were some of the safety issues being encountered. In the past year, the Agency had 
conducted a number of INSARR missions. However, given the global scale of the problem, 
more had to be done to achieve an adequate safety regime for research reactors. Member 
States were therefore encouraged to consider positively INSAGÂs proposal for the elaboration 
of binding norms covering the safety of research reactors. 
49. The safety implications resulting from decisions to close a number of reactors of Soviet 
design early were another cause of concern to INSAG. Operational safety from the time of 
the closure decision up to the beginning of decommissioning required specific programmes in 
order to compensate for the organizational and technical changes which occurred during that 
period. A decision for early closure could also reduce incentives for making the safety 
upgrades required at the facilities. The Secretariat would be requested to work more closely 
with the European Commission to ensure that relevant Agency safety experience, 
information, and services were made available to decision-makers. 
50. One area requiring particular attention was the decommissioning of nuclear power 
plants, research reactors, and other fuel cycle facilities. To meet the growing needs of 
Member States, the Agency needed to expand its activities in that area so as to ensure that it 
had the requisite technical expertise and was able to establish appropriate safety standards and 
assist in their implementation. 
51. The Safeguards Implementation Report for 1999 pointed to significant progress in some 
areas of the AgencyÂs safeguards implementation and a lack of progress in others. For States 
with safeguards agreements in force, it concluded that all nuclear material placed under 
safeguards had remained in peaceful nuclear activities or had been otherwise adequately 
accounted for. For the first time, it also drew conclusions about the absence of undeclared 
nuclear material and activities in the State Âas a wholeÂ for two States with Additional 
Protocols in force. 
52. The Final Document of the 2000 NPT Review Conference noted that 51 States Party to 
the Treaty had not yet brought into force comprehensive safeguards agreements with the 
Agency. Those unfulfilled legal obligations were a matter of long-standing concern. 
53. Since the last session of the General Conference, a further nine Additional Protocols 
had been approved by the Board of Governors; nevertheless, the total number of Additional 
Protocols approved was still only 54 - far short of expectations. Without the conclusion of the 
required safeguards agreement, the Agency could not provide any assurance about 
compliance by States with their non-proliferation obligations; and without the Additional 
Protocol, the Agency could provide only limited assurances that did not adequately cover the 
absence of undeclared material or activities. 



54. An important measure to strengthen and maximize the effectiveness of the safeguards 
system was the current development of new Âintegrated safeguardsÂ - the optimum 
combination of traditional safeguards measures with the measures of the Additional Protocol 
to ensure a system that was cost-effective, while achieving the maximum degree of assurance 
both of the non-diversion of declared nuclear material and of the absence of undeclared 
nuclear material and activities. Much preparatory work had been done already, and the 
conceptual framework for integrated safeguards should be completed by the end of 2001. 
55. Since December 1998, the Agency had not been in a position to implement its United 
Nations Security Council mandate in Iraq and was unable at present to provide any assurance 
that Iraq was complying with its obligations under the relevant Security Council resolutions. 
Nonetheless, pursuant to IraqÂs safeguards agreement, the Agency had carried out an 
inspection in January 2000. With the co-operation of the Iraqi authorities, the inspectors had 
been able to verify the presence of the nuclear material subject to safeguards still in Iraq. The 
inspection was not designed to be and could not serve as a substitute for Agency activities 
under the Security Council resolutions. The Agency would have to return to Iraq in order to 
fulfil the mandate entrusted to it under those resolutions and to provide the enhanced 
assurances sought by the Council. 
56. Since the previous session of the General Conference, there had been no significant 
change to the assessment made at that time with respect to the implementation of safeguards 
in the Democratic PeopleÂs Republic of Korea. The Agency was still unable to verify that the 
DPRK had in fact declared all nuclear material which should be subject to safeguards. With 
the construction phase of the light-water reactor project now under way, the time was 
approaching when the key nuclear components of the LWRs were due to be delivered. 
However, before that could happen under the Agreed Framework, the DPRK would have to 
comply fully with its safeguards agreement. There were many steps that the Secretariat had 
to take before assessing the correctness and completeness of the DPRKÂs initial declaration. 
The entire verification process might take between three and four years to complete. The 
Agency therefore needed to start immediately with full co-operation on the part of the DPRK. 
Given the recent positive developments in the Korean Peninsula, it was to be hoped that the 
DPRK would soon be ready to commence active co-operation with the Agency, as well as to 
make use of Agency expertise under normalized relations on important safety aspects of the 
LWR project. 
57. In keeping with the General Conference mandate, he had continued consultations with 
the States of the Middle East region regarding the application of full scope safeguards to all 
nuclear activities and the drawing up of model agreements which would contribute to the 
establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone. Regrettably, little progress had been achieved 
so far. Notwithstanding, he would continue to use all means within his authority, and with the 
concurrence of the States concerned, to make progress. He would be ready to organize a 
forum in which participants from the Middle East could learn from the experience of other 
regions with respect to comprehensive verification arrangements and confidence-building 
measures that contributed to the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone. 



58. The AgencyÂs Secretariat continued to make progress, in consultation with the Russian 
Federation and the United States of America, on arrangements for verifying nuclear materials 
excess to their military programmes. One important objective of the consultations was the 
ability to assure the international community that the material was irreversibly removed from 
military programmes. 
59. In addition to those consultations, in September the United States and Russia had signed 
a bilateral agreement on plutonium management and disposition, which committed each party 
to the withdrawal of 34 tonnes of weapons grade plutonium from its nuclear weapons 
programme. The agreement provided that each party would conclude appropriate agreements 
with the IAEA to allow the Agency to implement verification measures. The new agreement 
was a welcome step towards nuclear arms control and the Agency would naturally stand 
ready to discuss the arrangements for implementing the verification measures. 
60. With regard to the security of material, a comprehensive report had been submitted to 
the General Conference on activities undertaken since the previous year to strengthen the 
security of nuclear and other radioactive materials. The fact that the AgencyÂs database on 
illicit trafficking now contained some 330 confirmed cases, including the seizure in 
April 2000 of almost one kilogram of high-enriched uranium, showed the urgent need to 
strengthen national and international frameworks for the protection of nuclear and radioactive 
material. 
61. Turning to the technical co-operation programme - a programme supported by all 
Agency pillars - he said that 1999 had been a productive year in which the Agency had 
purchased more than $30 million worth of equipment for projects, had delivered 162 training 
courses and had fielded 2650 experts. Technical co-operation programmes had resulted in the 
training of more than 1000 fellows and 2300 participants in specialized courses. However, 
more important were the outcomes actually achieved, many of which were highlighted in the 
Technical Co-operation Report for 1999. 
62. Extensive discussions over the past two years had helped to focus programming on 
achieving tangible socio-economic impact in areas of priority for Member States. The 
discussions had been guided by the following lessons: first, technology transfer had greater 
impact when a strong partnership existed with the end user - frequently a water authority, 
health ministry, or livestock or plant protection service; second, to be effective, Agency 
technology had to be combined, in the recipient country, with political will, committed 
resources, and sustained effort; and third, those partnerships, resource commitments, and 
avenues of support were more likely to occur when Agency projects were linked to national 
development programmes. 
63. On the subject of the financing of technical co-operation, he noted that in 1999, only 
40 Member States had pledged and paid their full target share of the Technical Co-operation 
Fund, while 65 had paid nothing at all. If the Agency was to continue responding to demands 
for technical assistance from an increasing membership, it was essential that all Member 
States pledged and paid their target share in full and on time. 



64. Throughout the past year, the Secretariat had continued to re-engineer its management 
outlook on the basis of a Âone houseÂ concept to ensure better co-ordination and alignment of 
programmes, a more streamlined Secretariat structure and a more effective outreach policy. 
The increasing application of results-based principles had also helped to ensure better targeted 
and more efficient management. 
65. One of the most important changes to which the Agency had responded was the new 
emphasis on reaching out to its many constituencies - both traditional and non-traditional 
partners. The Scientific Forum held during the forty-third session of the General Conference 
had seen a large number of non-governmental participants. Since then, two very useful 
meetings had been held with senior managers from nuclear research centres and with nuclear 
industry representatives. Four widely attended regional public information seminars had also 
ensured useful dialogue on nuclear issues among technical experts, the media, and civil 
society. 
66. The Secretariat was already engaged in the preparation of the draft programme and 
budget for 2002-2003, using the new results-based programming and budgeting approach, 
which focused more on what was to be accomplished by the activities being funded and on 
the changes they would bring about in Member States than on the inputs and outputs. The 
results-based approach would enable the Secretariat to assess and address better the needs and 
priorities of Member States and would provide greater transparency. 
67. The AgencyÂs programme and budget estimates for the year 2001 once again reflected a 
policy of zero real growth. That policy, pursued for well over a decade, had forced the 
Agency into an increasing and excessive reliance on extrabudgetary resources. That 
reliance - to the amount of over $20 million - meant that the AgencyÂs Regular Budget was 
underfunded to the same degree. The situation made strategic planning more difficult and 
less efficient and restricted the SecretariatÂs ability to use its human resources effectively. It 
was therefore imperative that corrective action be initiated without further delay. 
68. His review of achievements and challenges illustrated the important role the Agency 
played in achieving the global objectives of Âfreedom from fearÂ and Âfreedom from wantÂ. 
In that context, it was heartening to note the explicit vote of confidence in the Agency 
expressed in the Final Document of the NPT Review Conference. Clearly much had been 
achieved, but more remained to be done. He was confident that, with the commitment and 
support of Member States, the Agency would continue to make an important contribution 
towards making the world safer and more humane. 



CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE TECHNICAL CO-OPERATION FUND FOR 2001 

(GC(44)/19) 

69. The PRESIDENT said that since 1982 the AgencyÂs policy-making organs had 
observed a practice of recommending Indicative Planning Figures to serve in fixing annual 
targets for contributions to the TCF. Following the agreement reached by the Board of 
Governors at its meetings immediately prior to the General Conference, a target figure of 
US $73 million had been recommended for 2001. The early pledging and payment of 
contributions to the TCF greatly helped the Secretariat in planning the AgencyÂs technical 
co-operation programmes, and he therefore urged delegations in a position to do so to notify 
the Secretariat during the Conference of contributions which their governments would be 
making to the Fund for 2001. He would report at the end of the session, under a later agenda 
item, on the contributions which had been pledged so far. 


GENERAL DEBATE AND ANNUAL REPORT FOR 1999 

(GC(44)/4) 

70. The PRESIDENT, pointing out that more than 80 delegates had already inscribed 
their names on the speakersÂ list, took it that, in order to avoid too many prolonged afternoon 
meetings, or even a night meeting - the total cost of the latter being more than $16 000 - the 
Conference authorized him, under Rule 50 of the Rules of Procedure, to limit the duration of 
speeches to 15 minutes. 
71. It was so agreed. 
72. Mr. COLOMBANI (France), speaking on behalf of the European Union and of its 
associated States, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, 
Malta, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia and Turkey, welcomed the applications for 
membership of the Agency by Azerbaijan, Tajikistan and the Central African Republic. 
73. The NPT was and should remain the cornerstone of the global non-proliferation regime, 
of which the Agency safeguards system was the essential instrument. The success achieved at 
the 2000 NPT Review Conference meant that the entire international community could now 
continue to advance towards full implementation of all the TreatyÂs objectives, namely 
nuclear disarmament, non-proliferation, and the development of the peaceful uses of atomic 
energy. 
74. The European Union welcomed the Final Document adopted by the Conference, calling 
for the immediate launch of negotiations for a fissile material cut-off treaty covering nuclear 
weapons and other explosive devices. It urged members of the Conference on Disarmament 
to overcome their differences and to engage as soon as possible in negotiations for a 
universal, non-discriminatory and effectively verifiable fissile material cut-off treaty. The EU 
would continue to work towards consensus on the matter. 



75. The EU also urged all States which had not yet signed or ratified the Comprehensive 
Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty to do so promptly and unconditionally, since the TreatyÂs entry into 
force would make a substantial contribution to the strengthening of the non-proliferation 
regime and to nuclear disarmament. 
76. The 2000 NPT Review Conference had confirmed the AgencyÂs role as guardian of 
non-proliferation and had expressed support for its efforts to ensure, through the safeguards 
system, that nuclear materials were not diverted from uses authorized by the Treaty. That 
mission called for unequivocal commitment from all Member States. If those safeguards 
were to be implemented, there should be full co-operation from all parties to the Treaty, and 
the EU regretted that more than 50 of those States Party had not yet entered into safeguards 
agreements. It called on those States to fulfil the obligation they had assumed under 
Article III of the Treaty to conclude such agreements. 
77. The States Parties to the NPT had been unanimous in recognizing the importance of the 
Additional Protocols to the safeguards agreements: the Member States of the European 
Union had signed Additional Protocols on 22 September 1998 and hoped they would be 
implemented as soon as possible. The European Union attached great importance to the 
achievement of a universal system of strengthened safeguards and urged all States with 
existing agreements to conclude an Additional Protocol without delay. 
78. The EU supported the AgencyÂs efforts to develop a system of integrated safeguards 
pursuant to the resolution adopted at the forty-second session of the General Conference, and 
welcomed the Director GeneralÂs stated intention to complete the necessary conceptual 
framework in 2001. The new system was designed to avoid unnecessary overlaps between 
measures provided for under traditional safeguards and those envisaged under the 
strengthened system, thereby making safeguards more efficient and effective, while reducing 
the costs to the Agency arising from the gradual introduction of strengthening measures in 
Member States. He commended the SecretariatÂs efforts to achieve cost-effectiveness within 
a neutral budget, as well as the proposed reduction in routine inspections, which should in the 
long run benefit States which had signed and successfully implemented an Additional 
Protocol. 
79. The EU considered that it was very important to ensure that there was strict compliance 
with agreements entered into under the NPT. It continued to be concerned that, despite the 
AgencyÂs efforts, practically no progress had been made since 1994 in the implementation of 
the safeguards agreement with the DPRK, notably in regard to verification of the initial 
declaration. It again called on the DPRK to comply fully with its agreement. It was to be 
hoped that recent developments in relations between the two countries of the Korean 
Peninsula would contribute positively to the solution of the issue. 
80. The situation in Iraq was another subject for concern, in that more than nine months 
after the Security CouncilÂs adoption of resolution 1284 there was still no resumption of 
verification activities in that country. The EU urged Iraq to comply fully with all Security 
Council resolutions concerning it, to give the Agency the necessary access to fulfil its 
mandate, and to co-operate with it unreservedly by providing a technically coherent picture of 



its clandestine nuclear programme. Although there had been a verification of the physical 
inventory of nuclear material under a routine inspection early that year, that verification could 
not serve as a substitute for the activities the Agency should be carrying out under the 
relevant Security Council resolutions. 
81. There was a need for continued vigilance in regard to illicit trafficking in nuclear 
materials and other radioactive sources. The prevention of such trafficking required an 
effective system of physical protection on the part of the State concerned. However, the 
AgencyÂs activities in that area were also important, notably the recent revision of the 
recommendations on the protection of nuclear materials and nuclear facilities, training, and 
advisory services such as the IPPAS. The EU supported the AgencyÂs co-operation with 
other organizations such as the World Customs Organization, Interpol and the European 
Commission. 
82. Safety should be a permanent concern and should continue to be improved. It could not 
be overemphasized that States engaged in any kind of nuclear activity bore the primary 
responsibility to their own people, to their neighbours, and to the international community for 
ensuring the safety of such activities. The EU therefore wished to stress the importance of the 
Convention on Nuclear Safety and the Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel 
Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management. Regular meetings 
between the parties to those conventions would help to foster the extension of the safety 
culture throughout the world. He urged all States to take early steps to ratify those 
conventions and to expedite the entry into force of the Joint Convention. He hoped that the 
second review meeting of the parties to the Convention on Nuclear Safety would result in the 
introduction of safety improvements. 
83. Further co-operative efforts were needed if safety was to achieve internationally 
accepted levels in all nuclear facilities, and the EU welcomed the essential role played by the 
Agency in assisting States to enforce their own national regulations. The Safety Series 
documents, as well as the OSART, IRRT and INSARR services were also making a 
significant contribution in that area. In the field of the safety of radiation sources and security 
of radioactive materials, a code of practice would seem an appropriate way of remedying the 
significant defects in the management of such sources. 
84. Since its establishment, the AgencyÂs mission had been to assist its Member States in 
developing the peaceful applications of nuclear energy. The 2000 NPT Review Conference 
had recognized the importance of its work as the main international body responsible for 
technology transfer. The AgencyÂs assistance was affected by the economic situation and 
consequent budgetary restrictions. It should always be guided by concern for maximum 
efficiency and regarded more as an incentive or catalyst than as a permanent subsidy. The EU 
supported the Director GeneralÂs efforts to ensure sound technical co-operation management, 
but it believed that the Agency could not act alone: corresponding efforts by Member States 
both in financing and in programme monitoring were vital. The EU strongly supported the 
Model Project concept and its implementation and appreciated the emphasis laid on a strict 
regulatory framework, especially in the field of radiation protection and security, and on 
proper enforcement in recipient countries. The EU also attached importance to measures 



taken to integrate technical co-operation into the economic activities of the country concerned 
and to ensure its consistency with national policies; regular reviews of project implementation 
and evaluation; enhanced co-operation between countries, especially within the framework of 
the AgencyÂs regional assistance programme; and proper co-ordination between the AgencyÂs 
technical co-operation activities and those of other organizations, with a view to avoiding 
duplication. 
85. The high level of voluntary contributions to the TCF on the part of member countries of 
the EU bore witness to its strong support for the technical co-operation programme. For their 
part, recipient States should demonstrate the importance they attached to such projects by 
making a significant contribution to them. He noted with regret that there had been 
considerable underpayment of assessed programme costs the previous year and called on all 
recipient States to comply with their obligations in that respect. 
86. The wide range of the AgencyÂs activities and the ever increasing responsibilities 
imposed on it had led to an increase in its financial burden. The Director General and his 
staff should be encouraged to continue their efforts to cut operating costs, to identify 
priorities, and to eliminate duplication in order to reduce dependence on extrabudgetary 
funding. It would be preferable if the strengthening of safeguards could be funded through 
the Regular Budget, and if each State were to contribute on an equitable basis, to the extent of 
their capabilities, to those measures, which were in the common interest. 
87. The EU attached great importance to the AgencyÂs programmes and the contributions of 
its member countries accounted for some 34% of the AgencyÂs Regular Budget. It welcomed 
the new approach proposed for the preparation of activities in the 2002-2003 biennium. In 
that regard, the recommendations of the Senior Expert Group, the various standing advisory 
groups and Member States should help in defining guidelines for the AgencyÂs missions and 
ensuring that the AgencyÂs programmes remained relevant and that priorities were defined 
with due regard to budgetary constraints. The AgencyÂs activities and those of other 
international bodies, in particular, the OECDÂs Nuclear Energy Agency, should complement 
but not duplicate each other. 
88. The Agency had shown that it deserved the trust of the international community as a 
competent authority for the verification of safeguards agreements linked to the 
non-proliferation of nuclear weapons. At the same time, it played an essential part in 
promoting the safe use of nuclear technology for peaceful purposes. The EU and its 
associated States therefore reiterated their support for the Agency and their resolve to 
continue to play a full part in its activities. 
89. Mr. OSHIMA (Japan), having welcomed Tajikistan, Azerbaijan and the Central 
African Republic as new members, said he hoped that the amendments to Article VI of the 
Statute approved at the previous session of the General Conference would soon enter into 
force so that the Agency could fulfil its role vis-Ã -vis those new members. 



90. Japan was very grateful for the co-operation extended by the international community in 
helping it to cope with the criticality accident which had occurred at a uranium processing 
plant in Japan on 30 September 1999. It had been the worst nuclear accident since Japan 
began the peaceful use of nuclear energy, and the Government had been doing its utmost to 
regain the publicÂs trust by taking all possible measures to prevent the recurrence of such an 
accident. It had been improving its risk management structure and its emergency 
preparedness measures, strengthening the safety regulations that applied to nuclear operators, 
and encouraging the nuclear industry to re-establish a safety culture. It was aiming to draw 
up a long-term programme for research, development and utilization of nuclear energy in the 
twenty-first century by the end of 2000. Japan intended to continue promoting nuclear power 
generation and the establishment of a nuclear fuel cycle, while ensuring that nuclear energy 
was used for exclusively peaceful purposes and that it was used safely. Japan intended to 
explain its new long-term programme fully to the international community, including the 
Agency, and to continue making its use of plutonium transparent and accountable to the rest 
of the world. 
91. The Final Document of the recent NPT Review Conference had succeeded in forging 
international consensus on many issues of nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation. Japan 
had particularly appreciated the fact that with regard to the relationship between the 
safeguards agreement and the Additional Protocol, it had been stated that, once concluded, the 
two agreements had to be read and interpreted as one agreement. Japan also considered 
important the affirmation by the parties that credible assurance of the absence of undeclared 
nuclear material and activity in a State that had concluded an Additional Protocol could 
permit a corresponding reduction in the level of traditional verification efforts with respect to 
declared nuclear material in that State. Thirdly, given the importance of the Additional 
Protocol, the States Party had recommended that a plan of action towards its universalization 
be formulated. 
92. Efforts to promote the Additional ProtocolÂs universalization should be intensified as a 
matter of extreme urgency, and Japan intended to take the initiative in drawing up a plan of 
action to that end. It was important that the collective resolve of Member States to conclude 
Additional Protocols promptly should be reaffirmed; that those countries which had not yet 
concluded such a protocol should be urged to do so through bilateral and multilateral 
consultations and by supporting the efforts of the Secretariat in its Medium Term Strategy; 
and that a proper forum should be established for discussion in order to create an environment 
conducive to accelerating the conclusion of Additional Protocols. In order to support the 
promotion of the conclusion of Additional Protocols, Japan intended to make extrabudgetary 
contributions to the Secretariat, and was ready to host a workshop on its universalization for 
the Asia-Pacific region in 2001, together with the Agency. 
93. Japan was following with great interest the way in which the DPRK was responding to 
international concern about its suspected nuclear arms development and urged the DPRK to 
fulfil its obligations under the safeguards agreement it had concluded with the Agency in 
accordance with the provisions of the NPT. Japan intended to continue its active support of 
the light-water reactor project being carried out by the Korean Energy Development 
Organization provided the DPRK fulfilled its obligations. 



94. As an Asian nation with an advanced nuclear programme, Japan could play an 
important role in co-operation towards the peaceful use of nuclear energy in the Asia-Pacific 
region, and he was pleased to announce that, despite its serious fiscal situation, his country 
would be able to resume its contribution to the RCA, which it had suspended the year before. 
He also announced that JapanÂs Atomic Energy Commission would be jointly sponsoring with 
Thailand the first session of the Forum for Nuclear Co-operation in Asia in November 2000. 
95. Japan greatly appreciated the efforts of the Director General and his staff to manage the 
Agency efficiently and soundly, and believed that the Agency could continue to meet the 
needs of the international community, even with a budget below zero nominal growth, by 
achieving further cost reductions in all operations, as well as by increasing the efficiency of 
safeguards. Japan greatly welcomed the fact that integrated safeguards had been identified as 
priority tasks for the Agency in the Final Document adopted at the NPT Review Conference 
and Japan was ready to assist the Secretariat in its efforts to ensure the prompt 
implementation of integrated safeguards. 
96. Mr. RICHARDSON (United States of America) read out the following message 
from Mr. Bill Clinton, President of the United States: 
ÂOn behalf of the American people, I extend greetings and best wishes for a successful 
General Conference. I am struck by the extraordinary developments and demands faced 
by this Agency in the seven years since I first addressed this gathering. But look how 
far we have come. New inspection capabilities were given to the IAEA after the crisis 
in Iraq and a potentially devastating confrontation with the Democratic PeopleÂs 
Republic of Korea was avoided. With regret we witnessed new nuclear tests in 1998, 
but rejoiced in the successful review of the Non-Proliferation Treaty earlier this year. 

ÂThese events make clear our collective and unwavering interest in curbing the 
awesome destructive power of nuclear technology and directing it to peaceful ends. 
This is a task in which - with the IAEAÂs help - we must succeed to avoid the terrible 
devastation that would result if nuclear weapons were ever used again. If the IAEA did 
not exist, we would have to create it. The IAEA needs strong and consistent support 
from all of its Member States. LetÂs devote out best talent and the full resources we can 
to allow the IAEA to continue its work. For a small investment, the IAEA returns 
incalculable contributions to peace and security.Â 


97. Although much had changed in the past eight years, many things still remained the 
same. It had been more than sixty years since Albert Einstein had alerted President Roosevelt 
to new research involving uranium that offered tantalizing prospects for the betterment of 
mankind but also called for vigilance. It was true that although nuclear energy promised to 
light the world and ease the miseries of poverty, it also harboured the power to destroy. 
98. The 1990s had witnessed unprecedented progress in the reduction of nuclear risks. For 
example, the United States had reduced its stockpile of nuclear weapons to 60% below its 
Cold War level. Further cuts were envisaged under START II and III. Nuclear weapons tests 
were no longer a fact of life. The United States firmly supported the CTBT and would 



continue to work for its worldwide ratification. The United States had also ceased its work on 
the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons. The time had come to end the 
stalemate in the Conference on Disarmament and to complete work on a fissile material 
cut-off treaty. 
99. Controls on existing materials should also be improved. Universal acceptance of the 
strengthened safeguards system of Additional Protocols remained a top priority. It was 
important to continue to curb nuclear materials that posed special risks, for example those in 
the DPRK, where United States and local specialists had prepared many tonnes of 
plutonium-bearing spent fuel for international safeguards. It was also necessary to monitor 
materials freed by recent cuts in nuclear arms, thereby preventing a return to the arms race. 
100. Work on the verification agreement for the Trilateral Initiative was nearing completion. 
The agreement would enable the Agency to verify that hundreds of tonnes of fissile materials 
removed from United States and Russian military stockpiles were never again used for 
nuclear weapons purposes. The aim of the United States Government was to submit an 
agreement to the Board of Governors at its December 2000 meeting. In similar vein, a 
plutonium management and disposition agreement had recently been signed by the United 
States Vice President and the Russian Prime Minister. That agreement would result in the 
destruction of 68 tonnes of weapons-grade plutonium, enough for thousands of nuclear 
weapons, and the Agency was expected to play a role in monitoring the agreement. 
101. The partnership between the United States and Russia had moved from a narrow focus 
on formal treaties to a broadly based and highly effective system. For example, in 
co-operation with Russia and the Newly Independent States, the physical security of more 
than 450 tonnes of plutonium and highly enriched uranium had been improved, just as civilian 
employment had been provided for more than 8000 former Soviet weapons scientists and 
engineers. Three hundred tonnes of spent fuel had been secured at the BN-350 breeder 
reactor in Kazakhstan, three years ahead of schedule. Similarly, purchases of Russian 
weapons uranium had been accelerated, thereby converting 80 tonnes of the material, much 
more than anticipated in the United States-Russia HEU purchase agreement. 
102. Furthermore, the new Sarov Technopark had recently been established under the 
Nuclear Cities Initiative and would unite former nuclear weapons workers with private 
industry, thereby speeding the conversion of facilities in RussiaÂs nuclear weapons complex 
towards peaceful production. The United States had also increased its co-operation with the 
Russian Navy by signing an agreement with its Commander in Chief, so as to provide better 
protection from theft or diversion for Russian naval nuclear fuel. 
103. The promotion of a framework for the peaceful use of nuclear energy throughout the 
world was an important priority. Research and development were being revitalized so as to 
ensure that nuclear energy was competitive and viable. It was necessary to establish a 
situation whereby communities and consumers worldwide were confident that nuclear power 
reactors could be operated safely and cheaply, and with due regard for non-proliferation and 
the long-term disposal of spent fuel and waste. In that connection, progress had been made 
on the Nuclear Energy Research Initiative and Generation IV Nuclear Power Systems 



Initiative to develop new reactor designs. Such work required the participation of more than 
one country and the Agency could also play a supporting role. 
104. In general terms, the AgencyÂs activities should be strengthened, inter alia through its 
Technical Co-operation Fund. The United States would pay more than $18 million to the 
Fund in the current year and urged all other Member States to follow its lead. However, 
vigilance was a necessary principle in preparing for the future of nuclear energy, while safely 
managing the consequences of the nuclear past. The decisions taken by Bulgaria, 
Kazakhstan, Lithuania and Ukraine to close down unsafe nuclear power reactors were to be 
applauded. The United States would continue to support the AgencyÂs nuclear safety 
programme and had been proud to host an OSART mission to the North Anna nuclear power 
plant, the fourth such visit since 1982. 
105. Safe decommissioning of older reactors was another priority. In that regard, the United 
States was working to assist Kazakhstan in decommissioning its BN-350 reactor and, in 
Ukraine, it was paving the way to allow early decommissioning of the reactors at Chernobyl. 
106. Finally, it was necessary to provide for the safe and secure management and disposal of 
spent nuclear fuel, waste and separated stocks of civil plutonium. In that vein, the United 
States had hosted an international conference on geological repositories, where it had been 
agreed that geological disposal was a preferred option worldwide, irrespective of the choices 
made by countries with respect to the nuclear fuel cycle. In order to accelerate co-operation, 
research, technology and procedures for geological disposal used in the United States would 
be made available to all Agency Member States. 
107. In conclusion, he said that all Member States should support the Agency, which 
embodied the principle of vigilance so well, the ultimate goal of which was a better and safer 
world. 
108. Mr. ZHANG Huazhu (China), having extended a warm welcome to the 
delegations of Tajikistan, Azerbaijan and the Central African Republic, noted that during the 
four decades of its existence, the Agency had met with great acclaim from the international 
community for its role and work. Nevertheless, he noted that it overemphasized its 
non-proliferation activities, while failing to pay due attention to the justifiable requirements 
of its developing Member States in the area of the peaceful applications of nuclear energy. 
The Agency could obtain general support from Member States only by faithfully adhering to 
the objectives and principles set forth in the Statute and by maintaining a balance between its 
two major functions. He therefore hoped that the Agency would make new contributions to 
the peaceful uses of nuclear energy worldwide. 



109. Noting the importance of nuclear energy and nuclear technology to sustainable 
development in the world, he said that the Agency had a crucial role to play. The twentieth 
century had witnessed rapid advances in science and technology, but also excessive 
exploitation of resources causing severe deterioration of the environment. More than 40 years 
of experience had proved that nuclear energy was clean, safe and economical; it should 
therefore play an important role in the future energy mix around the world. The Agency, as 
the only intergovernmental organization in the nuclear field, should not shirk its responsibility 
in that matter. The Agency could, inter alia: scientifically assess and objectively popularize 
the role of nuclear energy in global sustainable development; organize the exchange of 
information and resolve technological problems in response to public concerns about nuclear 
safety and radioactive waste disposal; co-ordinate the research and development work carried 
out in the Member States in preparing technologically for the new-generation nuclear power 
plants; and strengthen training and help developing countries to establish and improve their 
nuclear infrastructure. China was willing to provide experts for in-depth discussions of those 
matters with other Member States and the Secretariat. 
110. The Agency should do more to meet the developing Member StatesÂ requirements in the 
area of nuclear applications in industry, agriculture, human health, water resource 
development and environmental protection, which were closely related to sustainable 
development. The developed countries should make greater efforts to transfer technology and 
provide expert services to the developing countries, while increasing their contribution to 
the TCF. 
111. Turning to the safety of nuclear facilities and nuclear waste disposal, which was a major 
cause of the publicÂs doubts about nuclear energy, he pointed out that it was an issue 
requiring urgent resolution. The Agency had done a lot of useful work in that area. Since the 
accident at Three Mile Island and, in particular, that at Chernobyl, the Agency had played an 
indispensable role by drafting international conventions and safety standards, and by helping 
countries in eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union to improve nuclear safety. Recently, 
the Agency, together with the relevant United Nations specialized agencies, had held a 
conference, which had drawn scientific conclusions on the aftermath of the Chernobyl 
accident. Those conclusions were of importance in clarifying facts. In the area of nuclear 
waste disposal, the Agency had also made great efforts, including the holding of a scientific 
forum during the present session of the General Conference. The Agency, as an authoritative 
international organization, could accomplish much in that field, especially by giving objective 
publicity to the issue of nuclear safety and nuclear waste disposal to correct the publicÂs 
misguided opinions, by improving international conventions and standards on nuclear safety, 
and by strengthening technological exchange to help Member States to improve their nuclear 
safety levels. 
112. The safety and security of radiation sources had attracted the attention of all Member 
States in recent years. Relevant resolutions had been adopted at the forty-second and 
forty-third sessions of the Conference and an action plan initiated. Technical and legal 
experts from Member States had participated in a meeting held in Vienna in the preceding 
July where a Code of Conduct on the Safety and Security of Radioactive Sources had been 



drafted. Member States should be encouraged to use the Code as a guiding document in 
drafting related domestic regulations. 
113. Turning to the area of non-proliferation, he recalled that at the 2000 NPT Review 
Conference, the States Party had fully affirmed the AgencyÂs significant role in preventing 
nuclear proliferation. In the preceding 40 years, the safeguards operation had evolved from 
item-specific to comprehensive and then to strengthened safeguards. Many Member States, 
including China, had concluded Additional Protocols to their safeguards agreements with the 
Agency. The establishment of a stable global security environment based on mutual 
confidence was crucial to the prevention of the proliferation of nuclear weapons. However, 
non-proliferation activities should supplement promotional activities and not hinder the 
legitimate rights of Member States to develop the peaceful applications of nuclear energy. 
114. There had been significant progress since the end of the Cold War in bilateral nuclear 
disarmament between the United States and Russia. He looked forward to the SecretariatÂs 
report to the Board on the technical, legal and financial aspects of the verification of the 
dismantled nuclear material in those two countries. The AgencyÂs verification activities 
should strictly follow the provisions of its Statute and those of international legal instruments 
such as the NPT and the AgencyÂs role in nuclear disarmament verification should be decided 
only through negotiations involving all sides on the basis of the related international legal 
instruments. 
115. The prevention of illicit trafficking in nuclear material and effective physical protection 
of such material was another matter of concern to the international community. China had 
faithfully fulfilled its obligations as a signatory of the Convention on the Physical Protection 
of Nuclear Material. Recalling that, at the urging of some Member States, the Board had 
authorized the Director General to invite experts from Member States to discuss the need to 
modify the Convention, he pointed out that physical protection was mainly the responsibility 
of governments. China considered it inappropriate to lay down binding regulations on the 
physical protection of nuclear materials within a country in the form of an international legal 
instrument, in view of the differences between the specific situations in each country. The 
conditions for modifying the Convention did not yet exist. 
116. With regard to the development of co-operation with other organizations, it was natural 
for the Agency to develop co-operative relations with other international organizations 
belonging to the United Nations family and to establish mutually beneficial co-operation with 
other international or regional or non-governmental bodies. However, in doing so, the 
procedures laid down in the Statute should be strictly adhered to; co-operation with any other 
organization should not hinder the AgencyÂs functions or jeopardize the interests of its 
Member States, or affect the AgencyÂs independence and the integrity of its work; and all 
Member States of the Agency should be able equally to enjoy all the benefits arising out of 
such co-operation, given the difference in the membership of the different organizations. 
117. In conclusion, noting that the new century offered new hopes and challenges, he 
expressed his conviction that the Agency would continue to make new contributions to the 
peaceful uses of nuclear energy for mankind. 



118. Mr. EL SAIEDI (Egypt) said that Egypt had recognized the potential of nuclear 
energy and its applications for economic, social and human development over 40 years 
previously and had co-operated closely with the Agency in spreading the peaceful uses of 
nuclear energy in Egypt through the development of scientific and practical resources and 
manpower, and through active involvement in all the AgencyÂs activities. 
119. In a spirit of regional co-operation, Egypt had opened up its installations and 
laboratories and placed its expertise at the service of the States of the Arab and African 
region. It was a strong supporter of the Arab Atomic Energy Agency, especially its training 
programme in the areas of nuclear safety and seawater desalination using nuclear energy, and 
of AFRA, particularly Agency-backed economic and social development projects in areas 
such as surface and groundwater development and management, diagnostic and therapeutic 
healthcare, and the processing and storage of radioactive waste. 
120. It was essential to focus on technical co-operation projects that met countriesÂ real 
needs and produced tangible results. Such projects enhanced the credibility of the technical 
co-operation programme and assured it of the political and financial support of Member 
States. EgyptÂs co-operation programme with the Agency had concentrated from the outset 
on such key areas as radioisotope production, boosting of agricultural yields, improvement of 
the quality of livestock, expansion of arable land, and the processing and storage of 
radioactive waste. 
121. In view of the need for new freshwater resources in areas at some distance from the 
Nile, Egypt was collaborating with the Agency in the development and management of 
surface and groundwater resources and in the desalination of sea water. The radioisotope 
hydrological measurement laboratories developed in co-operation with the Agency were 
playing an important role in that regard, both for Egypt and for the States of the region. A 
study of the feasibility of using nuclear energy for seawater desalination and electricity 
production in Egypt was being undertaken with Agency assistance. The future use of small 
and medium-sized reactors for such purposes would be discussed at an Agency conference to 
be hosted by Egypt in May 2001. 
122. As the sterile insect technique had proved a highly effective means of fruit fly and tsetse 
fly eradication in many countries, Egypt had submitted a request for Agency co-operation in a 
regional project to eradicate the Mediterranean fruit fly, an ambitious project that would take 
many years to implement but promised to yield major economic benefits to Egypt and 
neighbouring countries, especially in terms of exports of citrus and other fruit. 
123. Egypt viewed nuclear non-proliferation and nuclear disarmament, especially in the 
Middle East region, as issues of the greatest urgency. Those who clung to the obsolete 
doctrine of deterrence were posing a threat to the security and stability of the entire region. 
Egypt had been working since 1974 for the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in 
the Middle East, a project unanimously endorsed by the United Nations General Assembly in 
1980. On 8 April 1990, President Mubarak of Egypt had called for the establishment of a 
zone free of all weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East. Egypt had furthermore 
drawn the attention of the Agency and other international forums to the need to apply the 



AgencyÂs comprehensive safeguards regime to all nuclear facilities in the Middle East region 
without exception. The Final Document of the 2000 NPT Review Conference noted that all 
States of the Middle East, with the exception of Israel, were parties to the Treaty and 
reaffirmed the importance of IsraelÂs accession thereto and the placement of all its nuclear 
facilities under comprehensive Agency safeguards. The international community thus 
attached special importance to disarmament and non-proliferation of nuclear weapons in the 
Middle East region. It followed that Israel had to cease its policy of impeding the general 
application of the AgencyÂs comprehensive safeguards regime in the Middle East and of 
undermining the credibility of the non-proliferation regime in general. In addition, the 
international community as a whole had to take vigorous action to remedy shortcomings in 
the implementation of the safeguards regime in the Middle East. Egypt would continue to 
pursue that goal through dialogue and to encourage the Agency to take steps to establish the 
appropriate regional structures. It trusted that Israel would prove equally keen to clear the 
region of the hazard of nuclear weapons and to embark on consultations concerning ways and 
means of achieving that aim, thereby responding to the many initiatives undertaken in the 
Agency and the United Nations General Assembly to create a climate conducive to serious 
dialogue on the subject and on other regional security issues. 
124. Egypt viewed technical co-operation as a key component of the AgencyÂs action to 
promote the peaceful use of nuclear energy and hence also of the international communityÂs 
efforts to prevent the spread of non-peaceful uses of such energy. It appreciated the efforts by 
the Director General and the Department of Technical Co-operation to enhance the 
effectiveness of the technical co-operation programme, especially on behalf of developing 
countries - particularly in Africa. Egypt fully supported the AgencyÂs strategy in that area, 
based on the Âpartnership for developmentÂ principle. At the same time, it wished to stress 
the need to make available the financial resources needed to implement such activities. To 
that end, Egypt had played an active part in the consultations conducted by the Chairman of 
the Board of Governors on the financing of technical co-operation and safeguards. While 
cautiously welcoming the outcome of the consultations, Egypt intended to keep a close eye on 
the implementation of the resolution on the financing of technical co-operation with a view to 
making any additional proposals it deemed necessary in consultation with other Member 
States. The developing countries had made a substantial concession when they had agreed to 
the new arrangements for the financing of safeguards. Being deeply convinced of the 
importance of the AgencyÂs role in that area, they were prepared to share the resulting 
responsibilities equally with other Member States. One could not help being struck, on the 
other hand, by the different approach adopted by Member States to the honouring of their 
financial obligations. The insistence by some States on maintaining the status quo provided 
strong evidence of the existence of double standards and constituted a breach of the principle 
of equality. While there were States that were genuinely unable to pay their contributions to 
the TCF owing to economic and political circumstances, there were also States that viewed 
the use of the term ÂvoluntaryÂ in the AgencyÂs Statute to describe contributions to the Fund 
as according them sufficient flexibility to opt out of the payment of such contributions. It was 
inappropriate to use the term Âvoluntary contributionsÂ as a pretext for reneging on oneÂs 
obligations. Contributions to the TCF had acquired mandatory status, at least in political 
terms, since all States participated in the negotiations to fix a target figure for the technical 
co-operation programme. Moreover, the adoption by the Conference of a resolution 



concerning the financing of technical co-operation should be viewed, in the interests of 
credibility, as a political obligation binding on all Member States. 
125. In that context, Egypt wished to commend donor and recipient States that systematically 
paid their contributions to the TCF in full, demonstrating the importance they attached to the 
AgencyÂs strategic goal of supporting peaceful uses and applications of nuclear energy. 
Egypt urged all Member States to follow their example in order to ensure the continued 
success of the AgencyÂs technical co-operation activities and to prevent the development of 
an impasse that could result in a crisis for the Agency as a whole. 
126. Mr. Jung-uck SEO (Republic of Korea), having welcomed Tajikistan, Azerbaijan 
and the Central African Republic, said that while recognizing the limitations of the worldÂs 
natural resources, it was important to direct the development of science and technology in 
such a way as to preserve the global environment. 
127. Nuclear technology was expected to be subject to more intense public scrutiny owing to 
its potentially negative impact. Accordingly, the most important task for the world nuclear 
community was to step up its efforts to improve the acceptability of nuclear energy in terms 
of society and the environment, so as to meet a substantial portion of global energy demands. 
128. In that connection, a clear vision should be established satisfying public demands for 
safety and economic viability, and encouraging talented young people to pursue their careers 
in the nuclear field. Similarly, governments and non-governmental organizations had to work 
together to educate the public and promote a better understanding of nuclear energy. 
129. In the twenty-first century, the Agency would have to play a leading role in enhancing 
nuclear technology further and in assisting Member States to meet a variety of needs 
pertaining to the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. For its part, the Republic of Korea had 
endeavoured to achieve self-reliance in nuclear technology with the development of various 
reactor designs. The Government of the Republic of Korea was also planning to take part in 
international efforts to develop technologies for a safer, more economical and proliferation 
resistant reactor and fuel cycle. Korea had also made significant efforts to develop relevant 
technologies for the use of radiation and radioisotopes designed to improve the quality of life 
of its citizens and, in that connection, had prepared a technical exhibition that was being 
shown during the General Conference. 
130. Following the conclusion of a memorandum of understanding with the Agency in 1998, 
the Republic of Korea had expanded its nuclear education and training programmes for 
developing countries. In addition, it had offered to host the office of the RCA. 
131. Korea continued to make every effort to incorporate the recommendations of the first 
Review Conference of the parties to the Convention on Nuclear Safety into domestic law and 
was gradually implementing the recommendations of ICRP Publication 60. It also looked 
forward to the early entry into force of the Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel 
Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management and to the swift 
conclusion of the current international discussions on the safety of radioactive sources and 
safe transport of radioactive materials. The Republic of Korea was developing an information 



system on integrated radiation safety which was capable of tracing and monitoring all the 
processes involved in the use of radioactive sources. Furthermore, in September each year 
the country celebrated Nuclear Safety Day to promote safety awareness among nuclear 
professionals. 
132. He welcomed the adoption of the Final Document of the 2000 NPT Review Conference, 
which contained an unequivocal undertaking by the nuclear-weapon States to achieve the 
total elimination of their nuclear arsenals. Korea fully supported international efforts to 
strengthen the non-proliferation regime and looked forward to the early entry into force of the 
CTBT and an early conclusion of a fissile material cut-off treaty. For its part, Korea had been 
implementing its own national inspection system since 1997, in addition to that of the 
Agency, in order to enhance nuclear transparency. As a result, inspection goal attainment in 
Korea had been improved to 90% the previous year. 
133. With regard to the DPRK, he said that the fact that the DPRK failed to fulfil its 
obligations constituted a major challenge, not only to the AgencyÂs overall safeguards system, 
but also to the basic framework of the global nuclear non-proliferation regime. Although the 
Republic of Korea remained concerned about the lack of progress achieved, it believed it was 
important to recognize the new developments that had taken place in the region. The summit 
held between the DPRK and the Republic of Korea in June 2000 represented a significant 
turning point. It was therefore hoped that a similar improvement could be achieved in 
relations between the Agency and the DPRK, and that the latter would rejoin the Agency as 
quickly as possible. 
134. As part of the effort to promote an interest in and understanding of nuclear energy 
among young people, the Republic of Korea would host the second Youth Nuclear Congress 
in 2002, which would serve as a forum for an exchange of views and understanding of the 
importance of nuclear energy. The Agency, for its part, should increase its role in 
establishing an international nuclear network among nuclear education and research institutes 
and professional training centres. 
135. Following the resolution adopted at the previous session of the General Conference 
regarding the amendment of Article VI of the AgencyÂs Statute, all Member States and the 
Secretariat were urged to make efforts towards ensuring its early entry into force. 
136. In conclusion, he said that in order to meet the challenges ahead, it was necessary to 
combine the wisdom and capacity of all Member States and to place even greater emphasis on 
the role played by the Agency. In that regard, the Republic of Korea pledged to perform its 
share of responsibility and to take part in the global effort to ensure the peaceful and safe use 
of nuclear energy. 



ARRANGEMENTS FOR THE CONFERENCE 

137. The PRESIDENT drew the attention of delegates to document GC(44)/INF/14 
entitled ÂStatement of Financial Contributions to the Agency as at 15 September 2000Â, 
which included a table indicating those Member States that had lost their voting rights by 
virtue of the application of Article XIX.A of the Statute. Communications had been received 
from Iraq and Belarus, which were among those Member States, requesting that their voting 
rights be restored. The Iraqi communication was contained in document GC(44)/INF/15; the 
communication from Belarus would be issued as a document in due course. Following past 
practice, such requests would be referred to the General Committee for initial consideration 
and report, and he proposed that such requests be dealt with by the General Committee at its 
second meeting. 
138. It was so agreed. 


The meeting rose at 1.15 p.m.

ARRANGEMENTS FOR THE CONFERENCE 

(a) ADOPTION OF THE AGENDA AND ALLOCATION OF ITEMS FOR INITIAL 
DISCUSSION 

1. The PRESIDENT said that the General Committee recommended that the agenda 
for the current session consist of all the items on the provisional agenda set forth in document 
GC(44)/1 and the supplementary item contained in document GC(44)/1/Add.1. 
2. With regard to the allocation of items for initial discussion, the Committee 
recommended that all the items listed in documents GC(44)/1 and GC(44)/1/Add.1 be taken 
up for discussion as indicated in those documents. 
3. With regard to the order of items, the Committee recommended that the order of items 
proposed in document GC(44)/1 be maintained; the supplementary item in document 
GC(44)/1/Add.1, entitled ÂOutcomes of the NPT Review Conference relevant to the activities 
of the IAEAÂ, should be included immediately after item 18, entitled ÂStrengthening the 
AgencyÂs activities related to nuclear science, technology and applicationsÂ, with the 
remaining items renumbered accordingly. 
4. Mr. TIWARI (India) said it was inappropriate to include the supplementary item 
just mentioned by the President in the agenda of the General Conference. Now in its 
44th year, the Agency pre-dated the NPT, and the General Conference had previously not 
been asked to devote time to the outcomes of an NPT Review Conference. Even when the 
NPT had entered into force, it had not been thought necessary to devote an agenda item to the 
matter. The General Conference risked setting an unfortunate precedent. 
5. Rather than pressing for a General Conference resolution endorsing their self-
congratulatory attitude, the beneficiaries of what was a discriminatory treaty should be 
seeking to establish a timetable for implementing an unequivocal commitment to global 
nuclear disarmament. 
6. Mr. FRANK (Israel) said his delegation had reservations with regard to the 
proposed inclusion of the supplementary item in the agenda of the General Conference. 
Although fully aware of the importance attached by many delegations to the final document 
of the 2000 NPT Review Conference, it was very concerned about the precedent which the 
General Conference would set by focusing on a text adopted by an international forum in 
which not all of the AgencyÂs Member States had been entitled to participate and about the 
unnecessary divisive debate on issues not directly related to the AgencyÂs mandate to which 
the supplementary item might give rise. 
7. Subject to the reservations expressed by India and Israel, the General CommitteeÂs 
recommendations regarding the agenda for the current session were accepted. 



(b) CLOSING DATE OF THE SESSION AND OPENING DATE OF THE NEXT 
SESSION 

8. The PRESIDENT said that the General Committee recommended that the 
Conference set Friday, 22 September as the closing date of the forty-fourth regular session 
and Monday, 17 September 2001 as the opening date of the forty-fifth regular session, which 
would be held in Vienna. 
9. The CommitteeÂs recommendation was accepted. 


REQUEST FOR THE RESTORATION OF VOTING RIGHTS 

(GC(44)/INF/15) 

10. The PRESIDENT said that the General Committee, which had had before it a 
request for the restoration of voting rights submitted by Iraq pursuant to the second sentence 
of Article XIX.A of the Statute, recommended that IraqÂs right to vote during the present 
session of the General Conference not be restored, being of the view that the failure of Iraq to 
pay the amount necessary in order to avoid application of the first sentence of Article XIX.A 
of the Statute was not due to conditions beyond its control. 
11. Mr. AL-JANABI (Iraq) said that, until the imposition of the illegal embargo on 
Iraq in 1990, his country had never been in debt to the Agency. Pursuant to certain United 
Nations Security Council resolutions, however, all Iraqi funds in international banks had been 
frozen, thus preventing Iraq from transferring its statutory contributions to any United 
Nations organization. 
12. Urging delegations to consider IraqÂs situation objectively, without reference to the 
double standards that certain countries were applying in order to prevent Iraq from voting in 
international organizations, he requested that the General CommitteeÂs recommendation be 
put to the vote. 
13. The PRESIDENT invited the Conference to vote, by a show of hands, on the 
General CommitteeÂs recommendation that IraqÂs right to vote during the present session not 
be restored. 
14. There were 44 votes in favour of the General CommitteeÂs recommendation and 
2 against, with 20 abstentions. The CommitteeÂs recommendation was accepted. 


GENERAL DEBATE AND ANNUAL REPORT FOR 1999 (resumed) 

(GC(44)/4) 

15. Mr. ELZUBAIR (Sudan), having welcomed the decision of the General 
Conference to approve Tajikistan, Azerbaijan and the Central African Republic for 
membership of the Agency, said that the Middle East continued to be a source of worldwide 
concern owing to the nuclear capabilities of Israel and that countryÂs refusal to accede to the 
NPT and place all its nuclear facilities under Agency safeguards. He hoped that the General 
Conference would adopt the draft resolution on ÂIsraeli nuclear capabilities and threatÂ to be 



submitted by Arab Member States, since it was time for the international community to take 
decisive steps in dealing with the Israeli nuclear threat now that all Arab States had acceded 
to the NPT. 
16. Welcoming the 1999 increase in the implementation rate for technical co-operation 
between the Agency and Sudan and the approval in 1999 of a Country Programme 
Framework for 2000-2005 based on SudanÂs strategic economic programme, he said that 
Sudan greatly appreciated the services provided by Agency experts. In addition, he 
emphasized the importance attached by SudanÂs authorities to the visits which the Deputy 
Director General for Technical Co-operation and the Deputy Director General for Nuclear 
Sciences and Applications had paid to his country. 
17. Sudan was very grateful for the AgencyÂs work in the area of nuclear applications, 
especially the support of the Agency for efforts to combat endemic diseases in Africa. It 
hoped that the Agency would help to combat malaria, more than 90% of the cases of which 
occurred in Africa. 
18. No increase in the target for contributions to the TCF was being proposed despite the 
fact that the Group of 77 and China had agreed to the termination of the ÂshieldingÂ system 
relating to contributions towards the safeguards component of the Regular Budget. That was 
most regrettable. 
19. In conclusion, he said that his country attached great importance to the AgencyÂs role in 
the field of international peace and security and in the promotion of development and 
expressed the hope that all Member States would fulfil their obligations vis-Ã -vis the Agency. 
20. Mr. DEMCHUK (Belarus), welcoming the growing reputation of the Agency and 
the broadening of its activities, said that it was difficult to imagine the future of mankind 
without nuclear power. 
21. Although Belarus would not begin construction of a nuclear power station during the 
next ten years, it would continue scientific research relating to the use of nuclear power and 
carry out feasibility studies relating to the construction of a nuclear power station in due 
course. In those feasibility studies, it would be necessary to take into account the importance 
attached to nuclear safety by the Belarus population following the Chernobyl disaster and 
BelarusÂs general economic situation. 
22. In its domestic and foreign policy, his country was guided by the principles of nuclear 
non-proliferation. It had acceded to the Treaty on the Reduction and Limitation of Strategic 
Offensive Arms and to the NPT as a non-nuclear-weapon State, subsequently concluding a 
safeguards agreement with the Agency. It had been one of the first States to sign the CTBT. 
Also, in support of the AgencyÂs efforts in the field of nuclear non-proliferation it had 
recently joined the Nuclear Suppliers Group. 
23. His country welcomed the AgencyÂs activities relating to the security of nuclear 
materials and other radiation sources waste and to the prevention of illicit trafficking in them. 



24. Belarus was fulfilling all the obligations arising out of its safeguards agreement with the 
Agency and was considering the possibility of the conclusion of a Protocol additional to that 
agreement. In that connection, his country was grateful for the way in which the AgencyÂs 
Secretariat was supporting the preparations for a regional seminar on the provisions of the 
Model Additional Protocol which was to be held in Minsk in November. 
25. Belarus was already implementing some safeguards-strengthening measures: Agency 
inspectors had been granted access to hot cells in order that they might take swipe samples, 
and the Government had in June given approval for the installation of a remote monitoring 
system at the ÂSosnyÂ Science and Technology Complex. 
26. Belarus, which was participating in the work of the open-ended group of experts 
considering whether there was a need to revise the Convention on the Physical Protection of 
Nuclear Material, would, if a decision to revise the Convention was taken, endeavour to 
ensure that account was taken of the interests of those countries which did not have the 
infrastructures and financial resources necessary for strengthened physical protection at the 
national level. In that connection, he was sure that the International Physical Protection 
Advisory Service (IPPAS) mission to Belarus which had taken place in May 2000 would help 
to resolve his countryÂs problems with regard to the physical protection of nuclear material. 
27. Belarus, which was participating in the AgencyÂs illicit trafficking database programme, 
would like to see an increase in the number of participating countries. Also, it would 
welcome the holding of a seminar for countries of Central and Eastern Europe similar to the 
one held in December 1999 for the countries of Central Asia, Armenia, Azerbaijan and 
Georgia. 
28. As the AgencyÂs radiation protection recommendations were not binding, many 
countries were being guided by their own principles in establishing radiation monitoring 
systems. That could lead to complications at the borders between countries with different 
approaches to radiation monitoring and with monitoring equipment of differing sensitivities; 
shipments passing unhindered through countries with lenient regulations might well be held 
up at the border crossings into countries with stricter regulations. It was therefore important 
to develop - possibly with Agency participation - a universal approach. The technical 
requirements had been worked out through the AgencyÂs Illicit Trafficking Radiation 
Assessment Programme (ITRAP), and the next step should be to formulate recommendations 
with regard to monitoring system principles and to common regulatory goals for the purpose 
of co-ordinating activities for the detection of unauthorized transboundary movements of 
nuclear and other radioactive materials. 
29. Belarus would welcome greater international co-operation in the area of nuclear safety. 
For its part, it had signed and ratified all the international safety conventions in force, and had 
also signed the Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety 
of Radioactive Waste Management, for which the ratification procedures were under way. 
30. Safety in the use of nuclear technology was a subject of particular interest to Belarus in 
the light of the Chernobyl disaster. Regrettably, however, the consequences of the disaster 



were no longer a focus of international attention. The economic, social and humanitarian 
aspects of the disaster, which were compounding the difficulties of BelarusÂs transition to a 
market economy, should not be underestimated, and he hoped that the draft resolution entitled 
ÂRadiological criteria for long-lived radionuclides in commodities (especially foodstuffs and 
wood)Â submitted to the General Conference by Belarus would receive broad support. The 
Chernobyl disaster had made the world aware of the need to strengthen nuclear and radiation 
safety, but the peoples of Belarus, Ukraine and Russia seemed to be paying the price of that 
awareness. 
31. A recent report of the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic 
Radiation was an example of the bias which existed with regard to the consequences of the 
Chernobyl disaster: it drew on arbitrarily selected data, hardly any of which had been 
provided by Belarus scientists, and gave an incomplete and tendentious account of the post-
Chernobyl situation in the countries affected. In the preparation of future documents, use 
should be made of more reliable epidemiological data covering the entire post-Chernobyl 
period obtained in Belarus, Russian and Ukraine by means of a single methodology 
32. Agency technical co-operation activities could help to rebuild the Belarus publicÂs 
confidence in nuclear technologies, and he was grateful to the Deputy Director General for 
Technical Co-operation and his staff for the technical assistance provided to his country. 
Belarus appreciated the valuable role played by the Department of Technical Co-operation in 
technology transfer and welcomed the DepartmentÂs ÂPartnership in DevelopmentÂ approach. 
Outsourcing would undoubtedly contribute significantly to TCDC, and Belarus stood ready to 
host further training courses held under the auspices of the Department. 
33. In order to meet future challenges, the Agency should pay greater attention to the 
development of nuclear technologies. Efforts to identify areas where new nuclear 
technologies could be applied and to improve existing nuclear technologies had stagnated, 
and he trusted that the Agency would take the steps necessary for restoring the balance 
between the three pillars of its work. In that connection, it was worth recalling the initiative 
announced by RussiaÂs President Putin at the Millennium Summit in New York; 
implementation of that initiative would contribute significantly to nuclear non-proliferation, 
environmental protection and nuclear safety. 
34. Belarus had completed the domestic procedures for acceptance of the amendments to 
Articles VI and XIV of the Statute adopted by the General Conference, and it hoped that 
many other Member States would follow its example. 
35. Despite a difficult economic situation aggravated by the need to cope with the 
consequences of the Chernobyl disaster, Belarus was the only Member State to have agreed to 
a five-year plan for the payment of its arrears. It would continue to do its utmost to meet its 
financial commitments to the Agency. 
36. Finally, having commended the work done by the Agency in 1999 and endorsed the 
AgencyÂs programme and budget for 2001, he expressed the hope that the Agency would 
continue to play its unique role in helping to resolve the global problems faced by mankind. 



37. Mr. INTINI (Italy) said that the 2000 NPT Review Conference had represented an 
important step in strengthening the nuclear non-proliferation regime. The NPT was playing a 
vital role in promoting international peace and security, and the AgencyÂs safeguards - with 
Protocols additional to safeguards agreements - were essential for providing credible 
assurance of the non-diversion of nuclear material from declared activities and of the absence 
of undeclared nuclear material and activities. His Government expected to complete the 
procedures for ratification of the Protocol additional to ItalyÂs safeguards agreement with the 
Agency early in 2001. 
38. There was a need to keep a careful watch over the situation in the DPRK, and the Iraqi 
authorities should fully implement the Security Council resolutions relating to Iraq so that the 
Agency could complete the task assigned to it by the Security Council. 
39. Italy welcomed the recent announcement by the President of Ukraine that the Chernobyl 
Nuclear Power Plant was to be closed down permanently before the end of the year. 
40. The Convention on Nuclear Safety and the Joint Convention were important for the 
attainment of a widespread safety culture based on internationally accepted standards. 
41. Italy, which was greatly concerned about the safety of nuclear research reactors, 
supported the idea of the SecretariatÂs developing an international protocol or similar legal 
instrument to deal with the problem. Italy was also concerned about the persistent occurrence 
of incidents involving orphan sources, and it therefore attached great importance to the Action 
Plan for the Safety of Radiation Sources and the Security of Radioactive Materials. 
42. ItalyÂs Ministry of Industry had recently issued guidelines for the safe management of 
radioactive waste resulting from past nuclear activities in Italy. The envisaged waste 
management programme would require a strong national effort with international support. 
43. Expressing support for the AgencyÂs technical co-operation activities, which could lead 
to national investments by recipient countries in peaceful uses of nuclear energy, he 
welcomed the consensus recently reached in the Board of Governors, under the skilful 
guidance of Ambassador de Queiroz Duarte of Brazil, on the financing of those activities. He 
hoped that the consensus would pave the way to ensuring that the financial and human 
resources devoted to Agency technical co-operation were assured, predictable and sufficient 
to meet the relevant objectives envisaged in the NPT and the AgencyÂs Statute. 
44. Welcoming the results-based approach to programming and budgeting advocated by the 
Director General, he said that it was essential that Member States and the Secretariat 
prioritize the AgencyÂs activities with a view to reconciling zero real budgetary growth with 
the requests made of the Agency by Member States and the AgencyÂs statutory obligations. 
The recommendations of the Senior Expert Group and of bodies like the recently established 
Standing Advisory Group on Nuclear Applications (SAGNA) could be helpful in that 
connection. 
45. The budgetary situation of the Agency had reached the point where new approaches 
were necessary if the Secretariat was to continue carrying out its tasks effectively and 



efficiently. At the same time, his country was concerned about the AgencyÂs increasing 
reliance on extrabudgetary resources, which was undermining the control of Member States 
over the budgeting process and making strategic planning more difficult. The fact that some 
23% of the financial resources for safeguards were extrabudgetary might result in a 
weakening of the effectiveness of the safeguards system, a matter of particular concern to his 
country. 
46. Expressing support for the current process of restructuring the Regular Budget and 
reconsidering priorities, with a view to closing the gap between the tasks assigned to the 
Secretariat and the resources available for carrying them out, he said that there was room for 
further economies and efficiency gains. 
47. As a major and reliable contributor of financial resources, his country would like to see 
its commitment to the Agency reciprocated by the Secretariat when considering applications 
for senior posts from under-represented Member States. 
48. Italy would continue to work actively with the Secretariat and with other Member States 
in examining priorities, with a view to ensuring that the AgencyÂs activities were sharply 
focused and fully responsive to important needs and matched by the resources available. 
49. Mr. AGHAZADEH (Islamic Republic of Iran), having welcomed the approval of 
Tajikistan, Azerbaijan and the Central African Republic for membership of the Agency, 
expressed the hope that the recent Millennium Session of the United Nations - an idea put 
forward by the President of his own country - would lead to a millennium of peace based on 
dialogue among civilizations. A world governed by wisdom and prudence was not 
compatible with the spreading of weapons of mass destruction. The international community 
had succeeded in prohibiting chemical and biological weapons worldwide, and the Islamic 
Republic of Iran believed that now was the right time to prohibit nuclear weapons through a 
convention similar to the Chemical Weapons Convention and the Biological Weapons 
Convention. 
50. His country, which had put forward the idea of establishing a nuclear-weapon-free zone 
in the Middle East in 1974, regretted that Israel was still showing no sign of embracing the 
NPT or entering into an equivalent legally binding commitment. IsraelÂs attitude was not 
only preventing the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East, but also 
undermining peace and stability throughout the region. The international community should 
pressure Israel into heeding international appeals, the most recent of which had been made by 
the 2000 NPT Review Conference, which had called upon Israel to adhere to the NPT and 
place all its nuclear facilities under comprehensive Agency safeguards. The Islamic Republic 
of Iran, which was concerned that IsraelÂs attitude might result in a dreadful - and futile - 
arms race, greatly appreciated the Director GeneralÂs untiring efforts to help resolve a vital 
regional and global problem. 
51. The Islamic Republic of Iran, all of whose nuclear activities were covered by Agency 
safeguards, wished to see the AgencyÂs safeguards system strengthened and also more done to 
promote the use of nuclear science and technology for peaceful purposes. In his view, the 



AgencyÂs safeguards system would be strengthened by the conclusion of Additional Protocols 
and the use of nuclear science and technology for peaceful purposes would be promoted by 
the lifting of restrictions on the supply of necessary equipment. 
52. The Islamic Republic of Iran believed that nuclear power could help to meet the energy 
needs of most developing countries, as the President of the Russian Federation had suggested, 
if the necessary international effort under the AgencyÂs auspices was made. 
53. Mr. ZBIDI (Tunisia), having welcomed the approval of Azerbaijan, Tajikistan and 
the Central African Republic for membership of the Agency, said that his country attached 
great importance to the peaceful uses of nuclear science and technology. It was especially 
interested in the possibilities offered by small and medium-sized reactors (SMRs) for power 
generation and seawater desalination, and it would like to see an intensification of the 
AgencyÂs activities relating to SMRs. At the same time, it was grateful for the Secretariat-
organized evaluation of a siting study for a nuclear desalination plant in Tunisia. It looked 
forward to the AgencyÂs continuing support for the efforts to meet its populationÂs increasing 
demand for potable water. 
54. Tunisia was trying to co-operate more closely in the field of nuclear science and 
technology with other Arab countries, either on a bilateral basis or within the framework of 
bodies such as the Arab Atomic Energy Agency, with which it would like to see the Agency 
intensifying its co-operation. 
55. Referring to the regional technical co-operation project on ÂPollution monitoring in the 
marine environmentÂ (RAF/7/003), the aim of which was to enable the countries of North 
Africa to assess radioactive and non-radioactive pollution of the Mediterranean Sea, he 
expressed the hope that European countries with a Mediterranean shoreline would support the 
project. 
56. Tunisia, which was interested in promoting scientific and technical co-operation among 
African countries in the area of peaceful uses of nuclear energy, had hosted a number of 
AFRA activities and stood ready to continue hosting such activities. 
57. The Agency had continued to support Tunisian research projects relating to the use of 
nuclear techniques in medicine, agriculture and industry, and France was supporting a project 
involving the installation of an electron accelerator at the National Centre for Science and 
Technology. His country greatly appreciated the support which it was receiving. 
58. Tunisia, which was endeavouring to pay its assessed contributions towards the Regular 
Budget and its TCF target shares in full, was very grateful to those countries which were 
paying very substantial contributions into the TCF. 
59. Tunisia considered that widespread co-operation in nuclear, radiation and waste safety 
and effective opposition to illicit trafficking in nuclear and other radioactive materials were 
essential for the development of peaceful uses of nuclear science and technology. It would 
therefore like to see all States which used nuclear techniques acceding to the relevant 
international legal instruments. 



60. With regard to the transport of radioactive materials, the Mediterranean Sea was a 
sensitive sea lane, and Tunisia was very much aware of the risks associated with that activity 
and would like to see the relevant transport regulations tightened up in the interests of greater 
safety. 
61. However, emphasis on safety - and on safeguards - should not be allowed to have an 
adverse effect on the AgencyÂs technical co-operation activities. Greater efforts must be 
made to establish an optimum balance between safety, safeguards and technical co-operation 
within the Agency. 
62. Tunisia, which had been involved in the drafting of - and had ratified - the Pelindaba 
Treaty, was ready to start negotiating a Protocol additional to its safeguards agreement with 
the Agency. His country would like to see the AgencyÂs safeguards system being applied 
universally and all weapons of mass destruction eliminated. It was therefore very concerned 
about IsraelÂs persistent refusal to become a party to NPT and place all its nuclear 
installations under Agency safeguards - steps which would strengthen confidence among 
countries in the Middle East and help to bring about the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-
free zone in that region. 
63. In conclusion, he said that his country, which believed that the Board should be 
enlarged and restructured in the light of the AgencyÂs growing membership, looked forward 
to the early entry into force of the amendment to Article VI of the Statute which the General 
Conference had approved in 1999. 
64. Mr. YERMILOV (Ukraine), having welcomed the ConferenceÂs approval of 
Azerbaijan, Tajikistan and the Central African Republic for membership of the Agency, said 
that President Kuchma of Ukraine had recently confirmed that the Chernobyl Nuclear Power 
Station was to be closed. The last operating reactor (Unit 3) would be finally shut down by 
15 December 2000. 
65. On 15 August 2000, Ukraine had signed a Protocol additional to its safeguards 
agreement with the Agency. The agreement, which covered all nuclear material in all 
peaceful nuclear activities in Ukraine, was being implemented successfully. 
66. The decision to close the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Station had not been an easy one 
for his country, owing to difficulties in the national energy sector and in the economy as a 
whole. Fortunately, agreement had been reached with the EBRD regarding loans to finance 
completion of Unit 2 of the Khmelnitski Nuclear Power Station and Unit 4 of the Rovno 
Nuclear Power Station, and it was expected that the EBRDÂs Board of Directors would take 
the corresponding positive decisions in the near future. However, the Khmelnitski and Rovno 
Nuclear Power Stations would not be generating power by 15 December, the deadline for the 
shutdown of Unit 3 at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Station. The only solution to the 
resulting power supply problem would seem to be the provision by Western countries of 
financial resources for the purchase of additional fossil fuel. 
67. The technical problems of decommissioning the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Station were 
enormous, but Ukraine was receiving assistance - for which it was most grateful - from the 



European Community, the G-7 and the United States with the establishment of the necessary 
infrastructure, including a spent fuel storage facility and radioactive waste treatment facilities. 
68. An extraordinarily difficult aspect of mitigating the effects of the Chernobyl accident 
was the ongoing transformation of the ÂShelterÂ into an environmentally safe system. The 
first stage of the operation was now coming to an end, and the second stage would begin 
soon. On the whole, Ukraine was pleased with the way in which the work was proceeding 
and with the support being received from the other participating countries and the EBRD. 
Following the recent visit of the Director General to Ukraine, his country was looking 
forward to receiving support also from Agency experts. 
69. Ukraine, which knew from experience the cost of underestimating safety problems, was 
supporting the AgencyÂs efforts to achieve higher levels of safety in the utilization of nuclear 
energy. Earlier in the year, the Ukrainian Parliament had ratified the Joint Convention on the 
Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management and 
the Paris Protocol to amend the Vienna Convention on Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage 
and had adopted legislation on the licensing of activities connected with the utilization of 
nuclear energy. It was fair to say that the legislative basis for the safe utilization of nuclear 
energy in Ukraine now existed. 
70. In Ukraine, nuclear power plants would for the foreseeable future - together with fossil-
fuelled power plants - constitute the basis for electricity generation, and work was under way 
on preparing a national programme of nuclear power development through 2010 and a further 
development outline through 2030. 
71. Ukraine had voluntarily renounced the worldÂs third largest nuclear arsenal and was 
prepared to actively support the AgencyÂs efforts to strengthen the non-proliferation regime. 
In that context, it had signed a Protocol additional to its NPT safeguards agreement with the 
Agency and was represented in the group which was considering whether the Convention on 
the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material needed to be revised. 
72. In the six years since Ukraine had signed the NPT, the legislative basis necessary for 
safeguards implementation in Ukraine had been created and an SSAC had been established. 
Agency safeguards inspections were taking place without undue problems, regular reports on 
the status of safeguards implementation in Ukraine were being prepared with Secretariat 
assistance, and information exchange between Agency and Ukrainian specialists was 
significantly reducing the risk of illicit trafficking in nuclear material. 
73. Ukraine, which greatly appreciated the technical assistance provided by the Agency, 
looked forward to continued co-operation in important areas such as strategic planning for 
nuclear energy development, the enhancement of safety at nuclear power plants, the extension 
of power reactor operating lifetimes, and planning for the decommissioning of power reactors. 
74. In conclusion, he thanked the Secretariat and the Director General for the work done by 
them during the past year and said that Ukraine would continue to fulfil its international 
obligations relating to the safe use of nuclear energy and strengthening of the nuclear 
non-proliferation regime. 



75. Mr. HIKAM (Indonesia), having welcomed the ConferenceÂs approval of 
Tajikistan, Azerbaijan and the Central African Republic for membership of the Agency, said 
that his country remained committed to the achievement of a nuclear-weapon-free world. The 
Protocol additional to its safeguards agreement with the Agency had been ratified and was 
being implemented. 
76. Earlier in the year, at an ASEAN-Agency workshop on the implementation of the 
Bangkok Treaty, Indonesia had proposed the establishment of an ASEAN safeguards system, 
with a view to - inter alia - strengthening mutual trust among ASEAN members. 
77. Scientists and engineers of IndonesiaÂs National Nuclear Energy Agency (BATAN) had 
increased the capacity of the TRIGA Mark II research reactor in Bandung from 1000 kW to 
2000 kW, and the ÂTRIGA-2000Â had achieved criticality on 13 May 2000. The AgencyÂs 
assistance in that connection was greatly appreciated. 
78. His Government had recently issued regulations on nuclear and radiation safety and on 
nuclear energy utilization which would facilitate implementation of the International Basic 
Safety Standards for Protection against Ionizing Radiation and for the Safety of Radiation 
Sources. 
79. His country was grateful to the Agency for assisting its Nuclear Energy Control Board with 
a regional workshop on ÂStrengthening national capabilities to respond to radiological 
emergenciesÂ and one on ÂThe development of a legal framework governing the safety of 
radioactive waste management and the safe transport of radioactive materialÂ. The time had 
come for countries of the Asia-Pacific region to develop their own capabilities for responding to 
radiological emergencies, and his country looked forward to the holding of further such 
workshops. 
80. In order to ensure their sustainable development, countries with limited fossil fuel 
resources should diversify their energy supply systems to include the renewable and the nuclear 
option. In that connection, Indonesia greatly appreciated the information being provided by the 
Agency on the potential role of nuclear power. It also greatly appreciated the support being given 
by the Agency to the introduction of nuclear power through the use of small and medium-sized 
reactors for electricity generation and seawater desalination. 
81. Indonesia, which had greatly benefited from technical co-operation with the Agency, stood 
ready to share its expertise with and make its scientific facilities available to other developing 
countries. In that connection, it would like the Agency to increase its efforts in support of TCDC. 
82. Welcoming the AgencyÂs Technical Co-operation Strategy and the ÂPartners in 
DevelopmentÂ concept, he said that the AgencyÂs technical co-operation activities were 
consistent with his GovernmentÂs policy of placing strong emphasis on end-users and the socio-
economic impact of science and technology. In keeping with that policy, IndonesiaÂs National 
Nuclear Energy Agency had established partnerships with ministries, provincial governments, 
universities, non-governmental organizations and the private sector for the development of 
nuclear techniques and their application in improving the general living conditions of the 
Indonesian population. 



83. Finally, having recalled that, at a meeting with the Director General, the President of 
Indonesia had reaffirmed his countryÂs support for the peaceful application of nuclear technology 
and had stressed that the Indonesian Government had an open mind regarding the nuclear power 
option, he said that Indonesia looked forward to further fruitful collaboration with the Agency 
through the latterÂs technical co-operation programme and within the framework of RCA. 
84. Mr. NOOR UDDIN KHAN (Bangladesh) said that the Prime Minister of 
Bangladesh, Sheikh Hasina, who was firmly committed to the peaceful utilization of nuclear 
energy, greatly appreciated the efforts of the Director General and his staff. 
85. The problem of arsenic contamination of groundwater had assumed massive proportions 
in Bangladesh, which planned to use a combination of conventional and nuclear techniques in 
carrying out the necessary investigations; it was hoped that those investigations would lead to 
efficient management of the countryÂs groundwater resources. A nation-wide project for 
assessing levels of pesticides in food items was under way, with a view to optimizing the use 
of pesticides and thereby reducing pesticide damage to human and animal health and to the 
environment. 
86. Bangladesh, which had adopted radiation safety legislation and regulations, was now 
strengthening its radiation safety infrastructure. Intensive training was being provided for the 
users - and regulators - of radiation facilities. As regulatory functions were not independent 
of promotional functions with the existing institutional arrangements, the creation of a 
separate regulatory agency was planned. 
87. Bangladesh, which was benefiting from the Model Project on ÂUpgrading radiation 
protection infrastructure in the East Asia and Pacific regionÂ, would like the Agency to 
initiate a separate project on that topic within the RCA framework. 
88. His Government, which had launched a nuclear power action plan, intended to invite 
international tenders for the countryÂs first nuclear power plant. An invitation to tender and a 
site report had been prepared by the Bangladesh Atomic Energy Commission, and the legal 
basis for a ÂNuclear Power Authority of BangladeshÂ was currently being formulated. 
89. Bangladesh greatly appreciated Agency technical assistance, particularly in areas such 
as human resources development, and hoped that such assistance would continue. Its 
involvement in RCA projects was providing excellent opportunities for the sharing of 
experience, expertise and resources on a regional basis, and it looked forward to a 
diversification and intensification of RCA activities. It was grateful to the Agency, UNDP 
and its other RCA partners. 
90. Bangladesh intended to continue playing an active role in the area of non-proliferation, 
and in that connection his Government had informed the Secretariat of its decision to 
conclude a Protocol additional to BangladeshÂs safeguards agreement with the Agency. As an 
expression of its support for the CTBT, his Government had recently consented to the 
establishment of a seismic monitoring station in Bangladesh. 



91. His country was concerned about the fact that the AgencyÂs promotional activities were 
being scaled down relative to safeguards. That trend might discourage those countries 
which -like Bangladesh - supported nuclear non-proliferation but were keen to take advantage 
of nuclear technology, and perhaps embark on nuclear power generation. It was important to 
strike a proper balance between the AgencyÂs promotional and regulatory activities. 
92. Mr. SANON (Burkina Faso), having welcomed the approval of the Central 
African Republic, Azerbaijan and Tajikistan for membership of the Agency, said that, as 
could be seen from the AgencyÂs annual report for 1999, nuclear power was still accounting 
for a large share of world electricity generation. Most nuclear power plants were in 
developed countries, however, and he therefore called for easier access to information on the 
role that nuclear power could play in developing countries. 
93. Commending the AgencyÂs regional or sub-regional approach to technical co-operation 
with African countries, he expressed particular appreciation of the AgencyÂs support for 
efforts to eliminate rinderpest in Africa. Such efforts should be backed by the timely payment 
by Member States of their full shares of the targets for contributions to the TCF. 
94. Since joining the Agency, in 1997, Burkina Faso had been participating fully in its 
activities. It had become a party to AFRA in 1999 and had set up an inter-ministerial body 
responsible for co-ordinating co-operation with the Agency. A national workshop on 
radiation protection had already been held in Burkina Faso with Agency support. 
95. Burkina Faso had participated in several seminars and workshops held under Agency 
auspices, and had been represented by its Minister for Animal Resources at a recent Burkino 
Faso-Mali-Agency meeting on preparations for a project to combat animal trypanosomiasis 
by means of the SIT. 
96. The International Conference on the Safety of Radiation Sources and the Security of 
Radioactive Materials held in Dijon, France, in 1998 had rightly highlighted the need for 
national systems of control for ensuring the safety of radiation sources and the security of 
radioactive materials. His country therefore welcomed the Code of Conduct on the Safety 
and Security of Radioactive Sources referred to in document GC(44)/7. 
97. Ms. SHABANGU (South Africa), expressing appreciation of the AgencyÂs recent 
involvement in a review of the technical and economic feasibility, the safety and the nuclear 
non-proliferation aspects of her countryÂs Pebble Bed Modular Reactor, said that the 
AgencyÂs report would be important for decision-making about a possible expansion of 
nuclear power generation in South Africa. 
98. There had been a significant increase in technical co-operation between South Africa 
and the Agency, and the implementation rate for Agency technical co-operation projects in 
South Africa was very high. The process of drawing up a CPF for South Africa had been 
completed, and should result in a rewarding programme of further technical co-operation both 
with the Agency and with other African countries. 



99. A Center for Postgraduate Education in Radiation Protection and a Regional Center for 
Isotope Studies in Ground Water had been established, with Agency assistance, at the 
University of Witwatersrand. With the help of such institutions, South Africa would continue 
to support AFRA activities and other efforts to bring about an ÂAfrican RenaissanceÂ. 
100. Revised nuclear safety legislation had been adopted in South Africa in February 2000, 
and extensive safety reviews had been carried out at the Koeberg Nuclear Power Plant during 
the past year - including reviews to ensure that the Koeberg Nuclear Power Plant, and the 
national electricity network, would not be affected by Y2K problems. 
101. A national radioactive waste management policy and strategy was being developed, 
with a view to South AfricaÂs becoming a party to the Joint Convention. 
102. Radioactive waste was continuing to be generated in the decommissioning of front-end 
nuclear fuel cycle facilities which had previously operated in South Africa. A programme for 
fully assessing such decommissioning waste, with a view to its subsequent safe management, 
was under way, and her country greatly appreciated the guidance provided by the Agency in 
that connection. 
103. Welcoming the outcome of the 2000 NPT Review Conference, she said that in the 
nuclear non-proliferation area there existed a Âstrategic partnershipÂ between the Agency and 
the international community; the proliferation of nuclear weapons could not be prevented and 
nuclear disarmament could not be achieved through the efforts of a single organization or a 
single State. 
104. South Africa welcomed the steps being taken to strengthen the AgencyÂs safeguards 
system. The challenge - to successfully integrate elements of traditional safeguards with 
measures which had only recently become available into an effective and efficient whole - 
required to some extent a change in safeguards culture. The only way of solving the problem 
of increasing safeguards obligations at a time of severe budgetary restrictions was a flexible 
system from which traditional elements not in line with modern requirements had been 
removed. South Africa hoped that the SecretariatÂs safeguards integration efforts would not 
only enhance the nuclear non-proliferation regime but also result in tangible benefits for the 
countries subject to safeguards agreements. 
105. In conclusion, she welcomed the ConferenceÂs approval of Azerbaijan, the Central 
African Republic and Tajikistan for membership of the Agency. 
106. Mr. KADRI (Algeria), having welcomed the fact that Azerbaijan, the Central 
African Republic and Tajikistan had been approved for membership of the Agency, said that 
the 2000 NPT Review Conference, over which a representative of his country had presided, 
had highlighted the importance of the AgencyÂs role in helping to strengthen the nuclear 
non-proliferation regime and the AgencyÂs need for adequate financial and human resources. 
The General Conference should do all it could to ensure that the measures called for in the 
final document of the 2000 NPT Review Conference were actually taken. 



107. Referring to the Pelindaba Treaty, he said that Algeria would like to see all African 
countries acceding to it and implementing its provisions. 
108. His country, which had signed and would soon ratify the CTBT, was closely following 
the progress towards its entry into force and supporting the work of the CTBTO PrepCom. 
109. Through its Atomic Energy Commission, his country was intensifying its relations with 
the Agency in several areas, especially safeguards and technical co-operation. 
110. Algeria, which had concluded a comprehensive safeguards agreement with the Agency, 
was following with great interest the activities aimed at strengthening the AgencyÂs 
safeguards system. The Atomic Energy Commission was establishing an SSAC, and in that 
connection a footnote a/ project entitled ÂNuclear material accounting and control laboratoryÂ 
had been included in the AgencyÂs technical co-operation programme for 1999-2000. As no 
outside donor had been found for the project, the Atomic Energy Commission and the Agency 
had agreed to fund it jointly. 
111. With regard to the AgencyÂs technical co-operation activities, he said that they should 
be expanded, made more effective and conducted more efficiently - and the financial 
resources for them should be predictable, dependable and sufficient. 
112. In Algeria, nuclear techniques were being applied increasingly in medicine, agriculture, 
industry, environmental studies and R&D. The technical co-operation project proposals 
submitted by Algeria for 2001-2002 indicated the extent of its interest in the use of those 
techniques in numerous sectors. 
113. Welcoming the extension of AFRA for a further five years, he called for revitalization 
of the activities being carried out within the AFRA framework. However, AFRA projects 
should not be strengthened at the cost of bilateral co-operation between the Agency and 
individual African countries. 
114. AlgeriaÂs Atomic Energy Commission had introduced revised procedures for licensing 
the import, possession and use of radiation sources. Special teams from the Commission 
carried out inspections at establishments where such sources were used and determined what 
safety improvements were necessary. Specialized training was being provided for users of 
radiation sources. 
115. Projects relating to nuclear desalination had no future without the active participation of 
advanced countries. Efforts should be made to show, through demonstration projects, that 
nuclear desalination was technically and economically feasible and safe. 
116. The obstacles to the application of Agency safeguards throughout the Middle East and 
hence to the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in that region were a matter of 
legitimate concern to his country. The establishment of such a zone in the Middle East was 
essential for world peace and security, but it would not happen as long as Israel was not a 
party to the NPT. As a party to the NPT, Algeria was anxious that Israel also become a party 
and place all its nuclear installations and materials under Agency safeguards. 



117. Algeria, which had joined in the consensus reached at the 2000 NPT Review 
Conference, would like the Director General to continue his consultations with all States in 
the Middle East, especially Israel, with a view to the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free 
zone in the region. 
118. As regards the amendment to Article VI of the Statute approved by the General 
Conference in 1999, Algeria believed that the Secretariat should encourage Member States to 
accept it with a minimum of delay so that it might enter into force soon. 
119. Monsignor RÃZEAU (Holy See), after recalling the Director GeneralÂs official 
visit to the Vatican in March, said that his delegation attached special importance to the 
Conference agenda item on ÂStrengthening the effectiveness and improving the efficiency of 
the safeguards system and application of the Model ProtocolÂ. As one of the 14 States with 
an Additional Protocol in force, the Holy See would like to see many other States concluding 
Protocols additional to their safeguards agreements with the Agency. 
120. Referring to the agenda item ÂMeasures to strengthen international co-operation in 
nuclear, radiation and waste safetyÂ, he said that dialogue, preventive diplomacy and 
consensus-building were far preferable in the long run to sanctions, which did not always 
produce the desired effects and often resulted in the penalization of civilian populations. 
Fortunately, the Director General and his colleagues were placing the emphasis on dialogue, 
preventive diplomacy and consensus-building. 
121. Moral factors could not be ignored when consideration was being given to mankindÂs 
energy needs, although the criteria involved were mainly scientific. The Agency was making 
commendable efforts to ensure that nuclear techniques were used, correctly and safely, for the 
development of disadvantaged countries in areas such as agriculture, hydrology, food security 
and medicine. The Holy See would like to see the Agency stepping up those efforts. 
122. Human beings had been given the freedom to organize their lives to the best of their 
abilities, but they also had a responsibility to administer the universe and its resources as a 
gift made to all human kind - both the present generation and future ones. In that regard, a 
balanced exploitation of various energy sources was a distinct possibility, if the advanced 
countries rationalized their energy consumption and the more disadvantaged countries were 
enabled to pursue economic development through the use of - for example - hydropower, 
solar energy and wind energy. 
123. Atomic energy held out the hope of real progress for human kind if properly used for 
the benefit of all. As Pope John Paul II had emphasized, the power of wisdom and love could 
overcome the growing menace of hate, and science could be made to serve human kind as a 
whole.

GENERAL DEBATE AND ANNUAL REPORT FOR 1999 (continued) 

(GC(44)/4) 

1. Mr. ADAM (Belgium), having welcomed the ConferenceÂs approval of 
Azerbaijan, Tajikistan and the Central African Republic for membership of the Agency, said 
that the 2000 NPT Review Conference, while not resulting in any major breakthrough, had 
not been the failure which some had foreseen. One very positive aspect had been the Review 
ConferenceÂs reaffirmation of the international status of the Agency as a pillar of the system 
for the monitoring of nuclear non-proliferation. 
2. The fact that the Agency had in 1999, for the first time, been able to verify both that 
nuclear materials had not been diverted and that undeclared nuclear activities had not been 
undertaken in two States demonstrated the importance of Protocols additional to safeguards 
agreements. 
3. Belgium was unreservedly in favour of the strengthening of Agency safeguards, but 
attached great importance to the assurances which had been given that strengthened 
safeguards would not be applied in a mechanical or systematic way. Unfortunately, there 
seemed to be a growing tendency to diverge more and more from the Model Additional 
Protocol and place a broad interpretation on the concept of Âcomplementary accessÂ, to the 
point where exercise of the right of complementary access was virtually a routine inspection 
measure. 
4. Belgium was looking forward to the completion, in 2001, of the preparatory work 
necessary for the integration of Agency safeguards. The integrated safeguards system should, 
without sacrificing effectiveness, be as simple as possible and impose the minimum of 
constraints on States. It should not be a mere agglomeration of traditional safeguards 
measures, measures adopted in 1996 and measures provided for in the Model Additional 
Protocol. Safeguards strengthening should go hand in hand with - for example - reductions in 
routine inspection effort in States which had concluded Protocols additional to their 
safeguards agreements with the Agency and where the Agency had ascertained that there 
were no undeclared nuclear activities - and the reductions should not, in the long run, be 
confined to cases where the nuclear materials in question were of only low sensitivity. 
5. Every Member State had a responsibility to help ensure that the Agency received the 
financial resources necessary for avoiding excessive reliance on extrabudgetary contributions. 
The Department of Safeguards was in a special situation in that regard, since the international 
community had assigned to it tasks which it simply must carry out. 
6. It was important that the financial burden of safeguards be distributed fairly. In that 
connection, his country was pleased that agreement had been reached on revised 
arrangements for the assessment of Member StatesÂ contributions towards the safeguards 
component of the Regular Budget. It would have liked to see the ÂshieldingÂ system phased 
out more rapidly, but was satisfied with the compromise arrived at thanks largely to the 
untiring efforts of Ambassador de Queiroz Duarte of Brazil. 



7. As a revision of the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material would 
absorb substantial resources, his country was closely following the current process of 
considering whether there was a need for a revision. So far, the need for a revision had not 
been demonstrated. 
8. Commending the SecretariatÂs efforts in the area of technical co-operation, he said that 
the close involvement of recipient Member States in Agency technical co-operation projects 
was essential if such projects were to bear fruit in the long run. The success of technical 
co-operation projects would undoubtedly make Member States more willing to increase their 
contributions to the TCF. 
9. Welcoming the agreement reached under Ambassador de Queiroz DuarteÂs guidance on 
the financing of technical co-operation, he said that Belgium would continue to try making 
contributions to the TCF which were in keeping with its share of successive TCF targets. 
10. In recent years, there had been frequent announcements of the inevitable decline - even 
the demise - of nuclear power, at least in industrialized countries. Electricity consumption 
was growing rapidly, however, and pending the emergence of large-scale energy supply 
alternatives compatible with the objectives of Agenda 21 and the Kyoto Protocol, there might 
well be a future for modern nuclear power sectors based on greater transparency and higher 
levels of safety. In that connection, the Agency had an important role to play as a provider - 
through, for example, documents like the ÂNuclear Technology Review 2000Â - of objective 
information which might defuse the ideological dispute between the supporters and opponents 
of nuclear power. 
11. His Government had decided that in Belgium the moratorium on construction of new 
power reactors should be maintained and that nuclear power generation should be gradually 
phased out (albeit with due consideration for the objectives of the Rio Conference and the 
Kyoto Protocol as regards the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions), but that the final 
shutdown of power reactors should begin only when they were 40 years old - so that there 
would be sufficient time to develop large-scale sources of clean, renewable energy. 
Questions regarding the implementation of that decision were to be examined by a 
Government-appointed international expert commission. 
12. Belgium had recently adopted new legislation relating to civil liability in the nuclear 
field. The new legislation increased the maximum damages payable in the event of a nuclear 
accident to 560 million euros. 
13. In 1999, BelgiumÂs nuclear power plants had operated without safety problems and in a 
generally satisfactory manner, accounting for a record 58.3% of electricity production. Their 
average availability had been 93.3% - also a record. 
14. Implementation of the 1978 reprocessing contract between Synatom and Cogema had 
continued in 1999, the final shipments of irradiated fuel - to La Hague - taking place during 
the last quarter of the year. The first return shipment of highly radioactive waste resulting 
from reprocessing at La Hague had taken place in April 2000, without any problems, and the 
waste was now being stored in a specially constructed building at BelgoprocessÂs Dessel site. 



15. The Belgian authorities were continuing to focus closely on the safe management of 
radioactive waste. Two programmes were under way, one covering low-level waste and the 
other dealing with questions of geological disposal. 
16. Dismantling of the BR3 reactor, the first prototype pressurized-water reactor in Europe, 
was continuing. 
17. The first stage in the industrial development of accelerator-driven systems for use in, for 
example, the transmutation of radioactive waste had been launched with the co-operation of 
European partners. 
18. In conclusion, he thanked the Director General and the Secretariat for their unstinting 
efforts to maintain the high quality level for which the Agency was renowned. 
19. Ms. BECERRIL (Spain) said that the outstanding performance of the Spanish 
economy in 1999 had been accompanied by a 6.5% increase in the consumption of electrical 
energy and that SpainÂs nuclear power plants had accounted for 28.3% of the electricity 
generated during the year. The plants had operated reliably, as reflected in the high 
availability factors recorded. 
20. At the same time, the operating enterprises had taken a number of initiatives to improve 
competitiveness - for example, the introduction of design modifications to increase generating 
capacity and the closer co-ordination of management to ensure the more efficient utilization 
of technical and human resources. 
21. Pursuant to a general radioactive waste plan adopted by the Government in 1999, work 
had begun on the construction of a temporary spent fuel storage facility at the Trillo Nuclear 
Power Station. 
22. Dismantling of the VandellÃ³s I power reactor was proceeding in accordance with a 
programme which envisaged a waiting period of about 30 years starting at the end of 2002, 
after which the final dismantling operations would be carried out. 
23. Her authorities, which had in December 1999 notified the Secretariat of the completion 
by Spain of the internal procedures for ratification of the Protocol additional to SpainÂs 
safeguards agreement with the Agency, were concerned about the fact that many States - 
especially States with nuclear facilities - had not yet concluded Additional Protocols. 
24. Commending the Secretariat on its safeguards integration activities, she urged the 
Department of Safeguards not to enter into new fields of activity that were liable to unduly 
distract attention and divert resources. The safeguards system needed to be overhauled, not 
only in the interests of greater effectiveness and efficiency but also because no lasting 
increase was foreseeable in the availability of financial resources. The overhaul should 
include a change in safeguards criteria and parameters, which would call for innovative and 
forward-looking decision-making. The global stagnation of the nuclear industry, with a 
concurrent stabilization of safeguards activities in quantitative terms, created a favourable 



environment for reform and also for meeting challenges such as those presented by the 
verification of nuclear disarmament. 
25. Spain did not attach high priority to safeguards activities in nuclear-weapon States 
under voluntary-offer agreements. Such activities should be allocated Regular Budget 
resources only if the Regular Budget financing of high-priority safeguards activities was 
assured, or they should be financed from extrabudgetary resources. 
26. Spain was opposed to heavy reliance on extrabudgetary resources, although such 
resources could serve a useful purpose now that zero-real-growth budgeting had become the 
norm at both the national and the international level. Where conditions were attached to 
offers of extrabudgetary resources, the Secretariat should examine such offers carefully 
before accepting them. 
27. At the first review meeting of the Contracting Parties to the Convention on Nuclear 
Safety, there had been frank discussions on such complex topics as the independence of 
regulatory bodies and the safety of old nuclear power plants. That augured well for the 
second review meeting, in 2002, and would - she hoped - encourage ratification of the 
Convention by those countries which, although operating or planning to operate nuclear 
power reactors, were not yet Contracting Parties. 
28. Spain, which had ratified the Joint Convention in 1999, looked forward to its entry into 
force in the near future. At the same time, it hoped that, when the Joint Convention did enter 
into force, most of the countries where substantial amounts of spent fuel and radioactive 
waste arose would already be Contracting Parties. Meanwhile, Spain was ready to help in 
drawing up the rules for implementation of the Joint Convention in the light of the experience 
gained with the Convention on Nuclear Safety. 
29. The dialogue between the scientific community, waste producers, waste management 
agencies and regulatory bodies that had been initiated at the International Conference on the 
Safety of Radioactive Waste Management held in CÃ³rdoba, Spain, in March 2000 could prove 
to be a major step towards achieving an international consensus on the subject of radioactive 
waste management safety. Doing nothing about radioactive waste was not an acceptable 
option; the present generation had a duty not to pass on undue burdens to future generations, 
and it should therefore try to work out viable solutions. It was against that background that 
Spain and its European Union partners had submitted a draft resolution on ÂThe safety of 
radioactive waste managementÂ. She hoped that the draft resolution would receive very 
broad support. 
30. Spain was continuing to support the AgencyÂs efforts to enhance nuclear, radiation and 
waste safety in South-East Asia, the Pacific region and the Far East, and particularly the 
AgencyÂs efforts to strengthen national regulatory bodies, and it had recently made an 
extrabudgetary contribution in that connection. Also, experts from Spain were continuing to 
participate in the work of the AgencyÂs Commission on Safety Standards and of the 
associated committees. 



31. Spain had hosted several OSART and ASSET missions and had also made experts of its 
own available for such missions. Her country would continue its policy of both using the 
AgencyÂs safety-related services and helping the Agency to provide them. 
32. Spain would like to see all States strengthening their national systems for the control of 
radiation sources. It therefore welcomed the relevant decisions which the Board of Governors 
had taken the previous week, especially the BoardÂs decisions concerning the Code of 
Conduct on the Safety and Security of Radioactive Sources. In Spain, a Âprotocol of 
collaborationÂ had been concluded the previous year between the Administration, the Nuclear 
Safety Board and Spanish enterprises which collected and processed scrap metal, with a view 
to ensuring effective radiation monitoring of the materials in question. However, the resulting 
measures would not completely exclude incidents unless there were rigorous controls of 
radioactive sources in countries of origin and co-ordinated international action. Spain 
therefore welcomed the fact that an International Conference of National Regulatory 
Authorities with competence in the Safety of Radiation Sources and the Security of 
Radioactive Materials was to be held in Argentina in December 2000. 
33. In March 2001, Spain would be hosting an International Conference on the Radiological 
Protection of Patients, which was to be held in Torremolinos (MÃ¡laga). Her authorities would 
make every effort to ensure its success. 
34. Spain, which was in favour of collaboration in the field of peaceful uses of atomic 
energy between the Agency and other international organizations, would like to see the 
Memorandum of Understanding between the Agency and the Nuclear Energy Agency of 
OECD finally signed. 
35. She welcomed the substantial increase in resources for Agency technical co-operation 
but expressed regret at the decline in the payment of assessed programme costs by recipient 
countries. 
36. Welcoming the compromise reached on TCF target figures for 2001 and 2002 and 
Indicative Planning Figures for 2003 and 2004, she said it was time to check the growth of the 
TCF target while the Regular Budget remained frozen in real terms. Her country would make 
every effort to contribute more to the TCF, it being understood that its contributions to the 
TCF were voluntary - and should be viewed jointly with the other voluntary contributions 
which Spain made in support of Agency technical co-operation activities, such as the 
contribution of US $411 000 which it had made in 1999 in support of a technical co-operation 
project in Ukraine. 
37. The variety of ways in which Spain was supporting Agency technical co-operation was 
an indication of the importance which it attached to the Agency. 
38. Mr. NIEWODNICZANSKI (Poland), having welcomed the approval of 
Tajikistan, Azerbaijan and the Central African Republic for Agency membership and having 
endorsed the statement which had been made on behalf of the European Union by the 
delegate of France, said that the great discoveries during the past century in the field of 
physics had yielded enormous benefits for mankind but had also created global dangers which 



could be countered only with the help of a system of widely accepted international 
conventions aimed at ensuring the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and the existence of 
an adequate safety culture in the peaceful applications of nuclear energies - a system in which 
the Agency played an important role. 
39. The final document of the 2000 NPT Review Conference had made it clear that Agency 
safeguards were recognized by the parties to the NPT as indispensable to the nuclear 
non-proliferation regime. Moreover, the Review Conference had underlined in its final 
document the importance which it attached to the conclusion of Protocols additional to 
safeguards agreements with the Agency. The Protocol additional to PolandÂs safeguards 
agreement with the Agency had entered into force and was being implemented, and Poland 
would like to see many other countries concluding Additional Protocols. 
40. It was a source of satisfaction that all countries operating nuclear power plants had now 
ratified the Early Notification Convention and that all except two had ratified the Assistance 
Convention and the Convention on Nuclear Safety. Only three more States needed to ratify 
the Joint Convention in order for it to enter into force. His country had ratified the Joint 
Convention on 5 May 2000, and it supported the idea - put forward by INSAG - that a 
protocol covering research reactors be added to the Convention on Nuclear Safety. 
41. The extensive applications of radiation sources and the associated risks had fully 
justified the initiation by the Secretariat of discussions on a possible Code of Conduct on the 
Safety of Radiation Sources and the Security of Radioactive Materials. 
42. The changes which had taken place during the 12 years since the entry into force of the 
Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material warranted efforts to prepare an 
internationally binding instrument on the physical protection of nuclear material also during 
use and in storage. 
43. Poland, which welcomed the AgencyÂs activities in support of efforts to combat 
Ânuclear terrorismÂ, had equipped almost all its border checkpoints to detect illegal 
movements of nuclear and other radioactive materials. 
44. Poland, which welcomed the SecretariatÂs efforts to make Agency technical 
co-operation more efficient, was ready to continue making its research centres available for 
the provision of training under the AgencyÂs auspices. 
45. Referring to the arrangement of the AgencyÂs major programmes and projects, he said 
that his country would like to see a close link between the AgencyÂs nuclear power-related 
activities on one hand and its nuclear science-related activities on the other. As a country 
without any power reactors, however, it would not like to see the AgencyÂs nuclear science-
related activities divorced from its activities relating to - for example - research reactors, 
accelerators, nuclear and atomic analytical methods, human health and agriculture. 
46. Calling for an enhancement of the AgencyÂs interaction with opinion leaders, the media 
and civil society, especially as regards nuclear power, he said that nuclear power tended not 
to be mentioned in statements and reports relating to energy and the environment. In a recent 



United Nations report on climate change, for example, nuclear power generation had not been 
included in the list of measures for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Greater use should be 
made of the ÂIAEA BulletinÂ in stating the case for nuclear power. 
47. Commending the Nuclear Technology Review 2000, he expressed the hope that the 
Secretariat would, when it prepared the next Nuclear Technology Review, take account of the 
comments on it made by his countryÂs delegation during the June session of the Board. 
48. Poland supported zero-real-growth budgeting in the Agency but was also concerned 
about the AgencyÂs heavy reliance on extrabudgetary resources. The failure of some Member 
States to pay their full Regular Budget contributions and TCF target shares only made the 
AgencyÂs situation worse. For its part, Poland would endeavour to continue setting a good 
example. 
49. Mr. ADAMOV (Russian Federation), having welcomed the approval of 
Azerbaijan, Tajikistan and the Central African Republic for membership of the Agency, 
recalled that at the Millennium Summit just held in New York, the President of the Russian 
Federation had proposed the phasing-out of the use of highly enriched uranium and pure 
plutonium in nuclear power generation. The proposal had been made in the context of efforts 
to ensure sustainable energy supplies for mankind while at the same time resolving the 
problems of nuclear weapons proliferation and ecological deterioration of the planet. 
50. Research carried out in the Russian Federation and other countries had shown that the 
objective was technically feasible, pointing the way to a resolution of the radioactive waste 
problem through the burning of weapons-grade plutonium and the transmutation of other 
radioactive materials. The Russian Federation had proposed the elaboration and 
implementation of an international project in that area under the auspices of the Agency. 
51. The proposals had received widespread support at the 2000 NPT Review Conference 
and been reflected in its final document. 
52. As the Director General had pointed out in his statement, the future of nuclear power 
would depend on success in developing innovative nuclear reactors and fuel cycles which 
were proliferation-resistant and economically competitive. His delegation therefore 
welcomed the initiative of the Director General in establishing a task force on innovative 
nuclear reactors and fuel cycles and hoped that it would lead to a large-scale international 
project under the AgencyÂs auspices. 
53. In its final document, the NPT Review Conference had recognized the role of nuclear 
power in ensuring sustainable development and stressed the need to resolve the problems of 
nuclear non-proliferation, nuclear safety and nuclear waste management at the technological 
level. Particular emphasis had been placed on the role of the Agency in assessing and 
promoting new nuclear power technologies. 
54. The new approaches to nuclear power must not repeat the mistakes of the past, which 
had given rise to criticism and - in some European countries - to serious moves to abandon 
nuclear power. To dismiss the criticism as purely subjective would be wrong; the nuclear 



community must realize that the crisis of nuclear power had profound causes and must adopt 
a responsible attitude towards them. 
55. The safety, waste and proliferation problems associated with nuclear power were 
serious. In many energy-deficient parts of the world, however, the climatic conditions were 
such that no alternatives to nuclear power existed. 
56. Against that background, his Government had in May approved a strategy for nuclear 
power development in Russia during the first half of the 21st century which envisaged an 
expansion of nuclear power generation three times greater than the expansion of other forms 
of power generation. 
57. Nuclear power could be the motor for safe, sustainable development both in Russia and 
in other countries. However, free-market mechanisms alone would not ensure the necessary 
transition; political will and governmental support for promising technologies would be 
essential. In that connection, his delegation hoped that the draft resolution in document 
GC(44)/COM.5/L.15 would receive the ConferenceÂs support. 
58. RussiaÂs top political priorities lay in the area of disarmament. Everything should be 
done to reduce strategic offensive weapons while maintaining strategic stability and its 
primary legal basis - the ABM. The ratification by his country of START II, the ABM and 
the CTBT confirmed its firm commitment to strengthening the nuclear non-proliferation 
regime, to disarmament and to the maintenance of strategic stability in the world. 
59. For some years, Russia had been transforming highly enriched, weapons-grade uranium 
into reactor fuel on a large scale in co-operation with the United States. The next question 
was what to do with weapons-grade plutonium. His country would like to see the 
establishment of an international mechanism for ensuring the uninterrupted financing of a 
programme under which weapons-grade plutonium would also be transformed for use in the 
fabrication of reactor fuel. 
60. Expenditure on nuclear disarmament could be partially offset by the ÂcommercialÂ use 
of Russian MOX fuel for electricity generation in countries possessing the necessary licences, 
with the subsequent return of the irradiated MOX fuel to Russia for safe storage. 
61. Commending the SecretariatÂs efforts to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of the 
AgencyÂs safeguards system, he said that in March the Russian Federation had signed a 
Protocol additional to its safeguards agreement with the Agency. 
62. Recalling the International Youth Nuclear Congress held in Bratislava, Slovakia, in 
April under the AgencyÂs auspices, he emphasized the importance of preserving continuity of 
knowledge in the nuclear field. 
63. In conclusion, he expressed the hope that there would be a breakthrough in the field of 
nuclear power so that mankind might fully exploit its potential. 



64. Mr. BAPTISTA NGANDAJINA (Angola), noting that the current session of the 
General Conference was the first session in which Angola was participating as a Member 
State of the Agency, said that his country, where radioactive mineral deposits had been 
detected in several regions, attached great importance to the peaceful uses of nuclear energy 
for sustained socio-economic development. 
65. His country, which was taking its first steps in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy, had 
recently hosted an Agency mission organized within the framework of technical co-operation 
project ANG/9/002 entitled ÂNational radiation protection infrastructureÂ. 
66. His countryÂs scientists and technicians needed training in the various applications of 
nuclear techniques and hoped that such training would be provided by other countries both 
through the Agency and directly on a bilateral basis. 
67. Welcoming regional efforts to increase the effectiveness of national programmes and 
regulatory bodies in the area of occupational radiation protection and to improve postgraduate 
training in radiation and waste safety, he expressed support for the activities being undertaken 
within the framework of AFRA, to which Angola hoped to become a party in the near future. 
68. Mr. RÃNAKY (Hungary), having welcomed the approval of Azerbaijan, the 
Central African Republic and Tajikistan for membership of the Agency, endorsed the 
statement which the delegate of France had made on behalf of the European Union. 
69. The 2000 NPT Review Conference, expressing its confidence in the Agency, had 
adopted a programme of forward-looking measures to further strengthen the international 
nuclear non-proliferation regime. His country would like to see that programme implemented 
with a minimum of delay. It would also like to see high priority being given to the 
negotiation of an FMCT in the Conference on Disarmament. 
70. His country, which believed that the Agency should assist in verifying nuclear arms 
reductions, looked forward to Agency verification of fissile material from nuclear weapons 
pursuant to the Trilateral Initiative. 
71. The Protocol additional to HungaryÂs safeguards agreement with the Agency had 
entered into force as of April, but his country was concerned about the slow rate at which 
comprehensive safeguards agreements were being concluded and the integration of 
safeguards measures was proceeding. 
72. He commended the efforts of the Agency to implement the NPT safeguards agreement 
in force with Iraq and to fulfil the mandate assigned to it by the United Nations Security 
Council in resolutions relating to that country. Also, he expressed support for the Agency 
activities directed towards full implementation of the safeguards agreement with the DPRK. 
At the same time, he said that his country was very concerned about the lack of progress in 
safeguards implementation in both Iraq and the DPRK. 
73. A national system designed to combat illicit trafficking in nuclear material and other 
radioactive substances had been established in Hungary; it had been tested late in 1999 during 



an exercise conducted at a nuclear facility in Budapest. Related Agency/WCO/Interpol 
training courses being held within the framework of a regional technical co-operation project 
had benefited from the practical experience gained in equipment testing conducted at the 
Austrian-Hungarian border. 
74. In May, HungaryÂs regulatory body had hosted an IRRT mission. The review team had 
identified a number of good practices and also made recommendations and suggestions 
regarding necessary or desirable improvements. A detailed action plan had been drawn up for 
addressing the recommendations and suggestions of the review team, which had stated in its 
report that they had been made to an organization Âseeking to improve its performanceÂ. 
75. As Hungary possessed relatively little in the way of natural energy resources, its energy 
security could not be maintained without nuclear power, which was not a subject of public 
debate in Hungary. The most important thing in that context was to ensure, through effective 
regulation, that nuclear facility operators maintained a vigilant approach to nuclear safety. 
Efforts to do that were benefiting from co-operation with the Agency and from various safety 
assistance programmes. 
76. The safe and reliable operation of the Paks NPP had continued during 1999, thanks in 
no small measure to high-quality maintenance resulting no doubt from effective utilization of 
the NPPÂs Maintenance Training Centre, which had been established through an Agency 
Model Project and at which some 500 people had received training in 1999. 
77. With energy markets becoming more competitive as a result of deregulation, an 
Agency-organized regional workshop on the impact of privatization and market deregulation 
held at the Paks NPP had been particularly timely. The participants had agreed that safety 
and profitability were not conflicting objectives. 
78. In 1999, no events jeopardizing nuclear safety had occurred at the Paks NPP, where 
intensive safety upgrading activities were under way, and authorization had been given for 
Units 3 and 4 to continue operating for a further ten years provided that certain safety 
improvements were made within the very strict time frame set for them. In that connection, 
he noted that a pre-OSART mission to the Paks NPP was to take place in November and a 
fully fledged OSART mission in 2001. 
79. Although further operation of the Paks NPP was widely accepted in Hungary, 
radioactive waste management remained a challenging issue. In 1999, following geological 
investigations, a site in Hungary had been declared to be potentially suitable for a repository 
for low- and intermediate-level waste. However, some experts had then questioned the 
completeness of the investigations. At HungaryÂs request, the Secretariat had organized a 
review by a WATRP team of the manner in which the investigations had been performed. 
The WATRP team had concluded that they had been performed in a careful, systematic 
manner and had confirmed the potential suitability of the site in question. Approval had now 
been given for continuation of the site selection programme, in line with recommendations 
made by the WATRP team. 



80. Emphasizing the importance of public acceptance of nuclear power, he said that 
Hungary had in April hosted a regional public information seminar on the peaceful uses of 
nuclear energy in Central and Eastern Europe, which had been organized by the Agency and 
the Hungarian Atomic Energy Agency. There had been a large number of participants, and in 
his view such events could contribute to increased public trust with regard to peaceful uses of 
nuclear energy. 
81. The activities of the AgencyÂs Department of Nuclear Sciences and Applications were 
already contributing to increased public trust with regard to peaceful uses of nuclear energy, 
and in that connection he welcomed the decision of the Director General to establish a 
Standing Advisory Group on Nuclear Applications. 
82. Commending the work done by the Secretariat in the field of technical co-operation, he 
said that the AgencyÂs technical co-operation activities in the European region were greatly 
enhanced by regular regional consultation meetings organized by the Secretariat. It was to be 
hoped that the next such meeting would lead to improved co-operation among regional 
resource centres. Hungary wished to contribute to such an improvement by sharing its 
expertise with other Member States. 
83. Hungary, which intended to pay its full share of the TCF target for 2001, welcomed the 
consensus reached in the Board of Governors on the financing of safeguards and the financing 
of technical co-operation, although it was concerned about how late that consensus had been 
arrived at. It would like to see all Member States respecting the consensus. 
84. Finally, he thanked the Director General and the Secretariat for their work and assured 
them of HungaryÂs support in meeting future challenges. 
85. Mr. CARRERA DORAL (Cuba), having welcomed the approval of Azerbaijan, 
the Central African Republic and Tajikistan for membership of the Agency, said that nuclear 
technologies were important for sustainable development and that the use of such 
technologies had had a tangible impact on the principal development programmes of Cuba, 
which therefore attached great importance to the activities of the Agency. 
86. Safety in the use of nuclear technologies had always been a high priority for the Cuban 
authorities, and that had led to the establishment of a solid regulatory infrastructure backed by 
highly qualified scientific and technical personnel with a high level of safety culture. Cuba 
was therefore in a position to contribute, through the AgencyÂs technical co-operation 
programmes, to the strengthening of radiation protection infrastructures in other Member 
States in its region. 
87. The AgencyÂs technical co-operation activities were an essential part of the process of 
technology transfer. Over the years, Cuba had made optimum use of Agency technical 
assistance in high-priority programmes with a large social impact and, despite economic 
difficulties, had consistently fulfilled its financial obligations vis-Ã -vis the Agency. 



88. Cuba was grateful to the Department of Technical Co-operation for the Agency 
technical assistance being provided to it, and particularly for the support being given to 
efforts to eradicate the screw worm in the Caribbean region. 
89. His country, which believed very much in regional co-operation, continued to regard 
ARCAL as a highly suitable framework for co-operation among countries of the Latin 
America and Caribbean region. 
90. With the needs of developing countries constantly increasing, Cuba was concerned 
about the decline in real terms in the financial resources available for Agency technical 
co-operation. A TCF with increasing and predictable resources could be achieved only 
through a high level of commitment on the part of Member States, and especially the 
advanced countries among them, not through technical subterfuges. His country therefore 
regretted the envisaged freezing of the TCF target at the level of $73 million for a further 
two years. 
91. Cuba, whose unequivocal stance in favour of nuclear disarmament was well known, 
supported the view that the non-proliferation regime in its present form was discriminatory 
and considered that the time had come for a move towards complete nuclear disarmament. 
His Government would welcome a strengthened - effective and efficient - safeguards system 
based on a universal and fair non-proliferation system leading to the immediate, complete and 
unconditional elimination of nuclear weapons. In keeping with CubaÂs stance, a Protocol 
additional to the safeguards agreements between Cuba and the Agency had been signed in 
October 1999, during a visit by the Director General to Cuba. 
92. Referring to safeguards financing, he said that the verification of non-proliferation had 
always been backed by increasing, predictable and assured resources. During the 30 years 
since the establishment of the ÂshieldingÂ system, however, the gap between rich and poor 
countries had widened, and elimination of the ÂshieldingÂ system would place greater 
financial burdens on countries least able to bear them. Proposals like the one aimed at 
elimination of the ÂshieldingÂ system were obviously above all a political subterfuge 
reflecting the policy which the United States of America had for some years been pursuing 
within the United Nations system with a view to reducing its assessed contributions and 
forcing other countries, especially developing ones, to cover the shortfall. In his countryÂs 
view, the proposal that the ÂshieldingÂ system be eliminated was politically questionable and 
economically untenable. The level of resources made available for financing Agency 
activities should be determined by the mandate assigned to the Agency in its Statute. 
93. At the Millennium Summit there had been agreement on the need to eradicate poverty. 
The Agency could contribute to the necessary efforts only if Member States displayed 
political maturity in fulfilling the obligations which they had pursuant to the AgencyÂs 
Statute. 
94. Mr. HOANG VAN HUAY (Viet Nam), having welcomed the approval of 
Tajikistan, Azerbaijan and the Central African Republic for membership of the Agency, said 
that his country, which was a party to the NPT and fully committed to nuclear 



non-proliferation, welcomed the continuing efforts of the Secretariat to strengthen the 
effectiveness and improve the efficiency of the AgencyÂs safeguards system. 
95. On 6 and 7 September, a workshop on Protocols additional to safeguards agreements 
and on legislation for safe and peaceful nuclear applications had been held in Hanoi with the 
assistance of Agency experts. Earlier, an ASEAN-Agency workshop on implementation of 
the Bangkok Treaty had been held in Thailand, demonstrating the commitment of ASEAN 
members to nuclear non-proliferation. As current Chairman of the Executive Committee for 
the Bangkok Treaty, Viet Nam looked forward to continued Agency support for 
implementation of the Treaty. 
96. In stepping up its nuclear non-proliferation activities, the Agency should not lose sight 
of its developing Member StatesÂ growing needs in the area of peaceful applications of 
nuclear energy. Viet Nam, which shared the concerns of many other developing countries 
about the decline in resources for Agency technical assistance, would like to see all Member 
States pledging and paying their full TCF target shares. 
97. Commending the efforts of the Department of Technical Co-operation, he said that 
Viet Nam had benefited greatly from Agency technical assistance. 
98. Noting that rice production remained one of the main sectors of Viet NamÂs economy, 
he said that new, high-yield and disease-resistant, rice varieties had been developed in the 
course of two Agency technical co-operation projects in Viet Nam, which would welcome 
Agency assistance with the establishment of a nuclear agriculture centre in the south of the 
country. 
99. Nuclear medicine services in Viet Nam had been upgraded with assistance provided 
through the Agency, whose support for the establishment of a centre for accelerator-based 
tumour therapy would be welcome. 
100. Noting that a regional training course on the radiation processing of natural 
polysaccharides had recently been held at the radiation technology R&D centre established in 
Ho Chi Minh City with Agency assistance, he said that Viet Nam was ready to make the 
centreÂs facilities available for a wide variety of regional activities, such as the modification 
of materials and mutation breeding. 
101. On the basis of the conclusions of - inter alia - an Agency-supported pre-feasibility 
study relating to the introduction of nuclear power in Viet Nam, his Government had called 
for the preparation of a nuclear power development plan. 
102. In the field of radiation protection, a national dosimetry calibration laboratory had been 
established, a legal and technical infrastructure had been created and a number of regulatory 
documents - including a national radiation protection action plan - had been drawn up. At the 
same time, Viet Nam would appreciate Agency support in its efforts to attain by 2002 the 
remaining milestones foreseen in regional Model Project RAS/9/021 on ÂUpgrading radiation 
protection infrastructureÂ. 



103. Mr. HÃGBERG (Sweden), having welcomed the approval of Tajikistan, 
Azerbaijan and the Central African Republic for membership of the Agency, said that the 
2000 NPT Review Conference had been a resounding victory for the NPT regime. For the 
first time in many years, it had been possible to adopt a consensus document on the agenda 
for nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament; and for the first time ever, the nuclear-weapon 
States had pledged unconditionally to eliminate their nuclear arsenals, with practical steps 
towards that goal identified. Sweden - like the overwhelming majority of States - regarded 
the final document of the Review Conference as the basis for further progress in nuclear 
non-proliferation and disarmament. 
104. Sweden, which also regarded the final document as a vote of confidence in the 
AgencyÂs role in promoting nuclear non-proliferation, saw a growing role for the Agency as 
nuclear arsenals continued to shrink and more States joined in a moratorium - which, it was to 
be hoped, would soon become a ban - on the production of fissile material for nuclear 
weapons and other nuclear explosive devices. It would like to see all States which were not 
yet parties to the NPT and the CTBT acceding to those instruments without further delay. 
105. His country, which would also like to see many more States signing and ratifying 
Protocols additional to their safeguards agreements with the Agency, looked forward to 
implementation of the AgencyÂs new, integrated safeguards approach and - through its 
safeguards support programme - would continue to assist the Secretariat in its efforts in that 
connection. 
106. Sweden, which assigned high priority to international co-operation in the physical 
protection of nuclear material and the combating of illicit trafficking in such material, was 
assisting several States of Central and Eastern Europe and Central Asia in that area through a 
security-enhancement support programme. The security of nuclear material was primarily a 
national responsibility, but the Agency also had an important role to play. An open-ended 
working group was currently considering, under Agency auspices, whether there was a need 
to revise the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material, and Sweden was 
looking forward to its findings. Also, the Agency was organizing a conference on ÂSecurity 
of material - measures to prevent, intercept and respond to illicit uses of nuclear material and 
radioactive sourcesÂ which was to be held in Stockholm from 7 to 11 May 2001, and Sweden 
hoped that it would be well attended by representatives of Member States. 
107. The Convention on Nuclear Safety and the Joint Convention were cornerstones of an 
international nuclear safety regime, and Sweden would like to see many more States acceding 
to them. It shared the concerns expressed by INSAG about the safety of research reactors in 
some countries and was voluntarily subjecting its research reactors - as well as its power 
reactors - to the Convention on Nuclear Safety. It would like the Agency to pay closer 
attention to research reactor safety issues, including the possible strengthening of the 
international legal regime relating to research reactors. 
108. His country would also like the Agency to pay closer attention to the special safety 
management challenges associated with decisions to close down power reactors. A 
substantial number of power reactors would be approaching the end of their technical and 



economic lives in the next few decades, and decisions to close down power reactors were 
taken also on grounds other than age. 
109. In documents like the Nuclear Technology Review 2000, the Agency should take a 
well-balanced approach to the issue of the possible role of fission technology in sustainable 
development. It should present the case both for and against fission technology, indicating - 
for example - why the Swedish Government had, like a number of other governments, 
decided that fission technology was not eligible for inclusion in a sustainable energy supply 
programme. In his countryÂs view, the question of the eligibility of nuclear power in relation 
to the trading mechanisms provided for by the Kyoto Protocol should be formally discussed 
only in the forums established by the Protocol for such discussions. 
110. Sweden, which had pledged its full TCF target share for 2001, believed that the first 
step in trying to ensure that Agency technical co-operation was properly financed should be to 
reduce - if not eliminate - the gap between TCF targets on one hand and the total amounts 
actually paid into the TCF on the other. It had therefore joined in the consensus on the 
financing of technical co-operation reached in the Board of Governors the previous week. 
111. In conclusion, he said that Sweden had recently accepted the amendments to Articles VI 
and XIV of the Statute which had been approved by the General Conference in 1999. 
112. Ms. DORAN (Ireland), after welcoming the approval of Tajikistan, Azerbaijan 
and the Central African Republic for membership of the Agency, said that her country had 
paid its full share of the target for contributions to the TCF for 2000 and hoped to contribute 
its full TCF target shares also in future years. The decision of her authorities to pay higher 
TCF contributions was in keeping with the spirit of the draft resolution on the financing of 
technical co-operation which the Board of Governors had, the previous week, agreed to 
recommend to the General Conference for adoption. 
113. Recently, several positive developments had occurred in the field of nuclear 
disarmament. The United States and Russia had moved ahead with bilateral nuclear force 
reductions. Russia had ratified START II and RussiaÂs Parliament had adopted the legislation 
necessary for ratification of the CTBT. The ratification of the CTBT by France and the 
United Kingdom, the two nuclear-weapon States belonging to the European Union, had been 
a significant step towards the establishment of the norm that nuclear weapons testing had no 
place on such a small planet. 
114. The nuclear non-proliferation regime remained the cornerstone of international efforts 
to promote the peaceful utilization of nuclear energy and curb the spread of nuclear weapons, 
and the adoption of the Model Additional Protocol by the Board of Governors had been an 
important step towards a strengthened safeguards system. The Protocol additional to 
IrelandÂs safeguards agreement with the Agency was due to be ratified soon. 
115. In 1961, when the then Foreign Minister of Ireland had tabled a resolution in the United 
Nations General Assembly calling for the conclusion of an international agreement which 
would prevent nuclear proliferation, the Irish Government had believed that he was launching 
a process which would ultimately lead to total nuclear disarmament. The Irish Government 



was still convinced that genuine international peace and security could not be established as 
long as States possessed nuclear weapons. 
116. The outlook for the 2000 NPT Review Conference had not been promising: on one 
hand, 182 States had demonstrated a commitment to refrain from the acquisition of nuclear 
weapons; on the other, the achievement of the total elimination of nuclear weapons - the goal 
of the NPT - remained distant. Thanks to the spirit of co-operation, the readiness to 
compromise and the flexibility displayed by the States party to the NPT, however, the Review 
Conference had produced an agreed final document which reinforced the bargain underlying 
the NPT. The nuclear-weapons States had committed themselves unequivocally to 
accomplishing the total elimination of their nuclear arsenals through a number of steps laid 
down in the final document. The agreed programme of action must not lead to complacency, 
however, and Ireland for its part would act vigorously to ensure that the ultimate goal was 
achieved. 
117. The Agency was playing a crucial role in the promotion of nuclear safety worldwide, 
despite the fact that many Member States had very divergent views about nuclear power. For 
Ireland, which had no wish to embark on a nuclear power programme, the trends in the global 
debate about nuclear power were of great interest. Those trends raised a number of important 
questions. For example, what was the most suitable way of protecting the present generation 
and future ones from the risks associated with nuclear activities? - how best to ensure the very 
highest standards in the area of nuclear safety? - how should one respond to advocates of 
nuclear power who believed that it was a great help in reducing greenhouse gas emissions? 
Despite its firm anti-nuclear stance, Ireland considered that such issues should be examined 
objectively, so that future policy-makers could make informed choices. The Secretariat must 
try to ensure that they were examined objectively. 
118. The Tokaimura accident had shown that even in technologically advanced countries 
there could be deficiencies of safety culture. Her country hoped that the necessary lessons 
would be learned from the accident and would like to see the Secretariat playing a major role 
in bringing about international confidence that the deficiencies exposed by the accident had 
been remedied. 
119. Ireland considered that all Chernobyl-type RBMKs should be shut down since, despite 
safety modifications, they remained less safe than other light-water reactors owing to inherent 
design faults. As to WWERs, Ireland considered that the earlier models should be shut down 
and decommissioned and that the later models should be shut down and decommissioned if 
they could not be upgraded to the highest international safety standards. 
120. The Irish public was very concerned about nuclear facilities in the United Kingdom, 
especially the reprocessing plants at Sellafield. It was opposed to the continuation at 
Sellafield of hazardous nuclear activities such as the reprocessing of spent fuel and the on-site 
storage of high-level liquid waste, and her authorities had stated their total opposition to the 
proposed establishment of a mixed-oxide fuel fabrication plant at Sellafield. Their concerns 
about Sellafield had grown after the publication of critical reports regarding its safety by the 
United KingdomÂs Nuclear Installations Inspectorate. 



121. In June, Ireland and eleven other countries had called for a review of current 
authorizations for discharges of radioactive substances from the reprocessing plants at 
Sellafield and La Hague, the aim being to encourage the adoption of non-reprocessing options 
such as dry storage and thereby minimize the risk of radioactive pollution due to accidents. It 
was to be hoped that the United Kingdom and France would respond positively to the clear 
signal which they had received from so many of their neighbours. 
122. Ireland, which would like to see nuclear safety issues receiving still higher priority 
within the Agency, was interested in co-operating with like-minded countries to that end. 
123. Mr. HOFFMANN (Executive Secretary of the Preparatory Commission for the 
Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization) said that the CTBT had been signed 
by 160 countries since being opened for signature and ratification on 24 September 1996. 
Moreover, 63 countries had already ratified it, including 30 of the 44 States whose ratification 
was necessary for it to enter into force. 
124. The ratification by the Russian Federation at the end of June had been an important 
recent development in that connection. 
125. The United States Senate had in October 1999 voted not to give its advice and consent 
to the ratification of the CTBT, but a high-level task force had been set up within the Senate 
to work out a bipartisan approach to ratification. 
126. During a visit to China in June, where he had met the Deputy Foreign Minister and 
senior representatives of the legislature, he had been informed that the ratification question 
was being considered in the relevant committee of the National PeopleÂs Congress. 
127. The support for the CTBT expressed at the 2000 NPT Review Conference augured well 
for its early entry into force. The continuing support of States which had participated in the 
Review Conference for the work of the Preparatory Commission was greatly appreciated. 
128. In August, at its 12th session, chaired by Ambassador Pellicer of Mexico, the 
Preparatory Commission had called upon States to seize the opportunity of the Millennium 
Summit to sign or ratify the CTBT. Guyana, Kiribati, Nauru, Nigeria and Sierra Leone had 
signed it and Kiribati and the Maldives had deposited instruments of ratification during the 
Millennium Summit. 
129. There had been significant progress with the establishment of the International 
Monitoring System (IMS), a global technical verification system for monitoring compliance 
with the CTBT. The progress made was due largely to the commitment of signatory States. 
A further indication of their commitment was the assessed contribution collection rate - about 
92% for 2000 and 96% for 1999. 
130. The Preparatory CommissionÂs Provisional Technical Secretariat now had 242 staff 
members from 70 countries. Of the staff members in the Professional category, 26.57% were 
women. 



131. With regard to the IMS, the Provisional Technical SecretariatÂs mandate was to develop 
a cost-effective global network of 321 monitoring stations - located in the 89 countries 
specified in the CTBT - with sensors capable of detecting, locating and identifying signals 
generated by a nuclear explosion using four complementary monitoring technologies: seismic, 
infrasound, hydro-acoustic and radionuclide. Approximately 20% of the stations had already 
been installed and were transmitting data to the International Data Centre (IDC) in Vienna for 
processing and onward transmission to signatory States for final analysis. 
132. A top priority of the Preparatory Commission and its Provisional Technical Secretariat 
was the elaboration of a draft on-site inspection (OSI) operational manual. As to OSI 
equipment, the first phase in the testing of a passive seismic equipment system was scheduled 
to begin in October. 
133. As to confidence-building measures, which were voluntary, in order to create the basic 
conditions for such measures the Preparatory Commission had agreed at its 9th session that a 
database on chemical explosions should be established. 
134. The relationship agreement between the Preparatory Commission and the United 
Nations had entered into force, so that the Preparatory Commission was now a member of the 
United Nations family. That had opened the way for co-operation with other family 
members, and the Provisional Technical Secretariat was currently negotiating a co-operation 
agreement with UNDP under which the latter would provide operational support services. 
135. In conclusion, he said that the Provisional Technical Secretariat looked to the signatory 
States to take the political steps necessary for ensuring the entry into force of the CTBT, so 
that all components of the envisaged regime could be brought into effect and the world made 
a safer and more secure place. 
136. Mr. ROMÃN-MOREY (Secretary General of the Agency for the Prohibition of 
Nuclear Weapons in Latin America and the Caribbean) said that the 2000 NPT Review 
Conference had underlined the importance both of the Agency and of nuclear-weapon-free 
zones for the international nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament regime. 
137. In October 1999, the Director General had paid an official visit to OPANALÂs 
headquarters, where he had attended a special session of the OPANAL Council and discussed 
the possibility of a seminar being held in Latin America on Agency safeguards and the Model 
Additional Protocol, as a follow-up to the very successful safeguards seminar organized by 
the Agency, OPANAL and the Government of Jamaica and held in Kingston, Jamaica, 
in 1996. Subsequently, senior representatives of the Agency had attended the 16th regular 
session of OPANALÂs General Conference, held in Lima, and an OPANAL seminar on a new 
international disarmament agenda for the new millennium. OPANAL greatly appreciated 
such indications of Agency support. 
138. The example set, in 1967, by the Tlatelolco Treaty had been followed in other regions - 
in the South Pacific, with the Rarotonga Treaty (1985); in Southeast Asia, with the Bangkok 
Treaty (1995); and in Africa, with the Pelindaba Treaty (1996). He expressed the hope that 
the current negotiations regarding the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central 



Asia would prove successful and, in that connection, welcomed the decision of the Mongolian 
Government to declare Mongolia a nuclear-weapon-free zone. He called for intensified 
efforts to establish nuclear-weapon-free zones in other regions, especially ones - such as 
South Asia and the Middle East - where confidence-building measures were essential for 
peace. 
139. In his statement to the General Conference, the Director General had expressed his 
readiness to organize a forum in which participants from the Middle East could learn from the 
experience of other regions with respect to comprehensive verification arrangements and 
confidence-building measures that contributed to the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free 
zone.1 OPANAL would be happy to support such a forum. 
140. In 1999, OPANALÂs General Conference had, in a declaration (the ÂLima AppealÂ) 
addressed to the international community, called for a complete prohibition of the use and 
production of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction and had urged those 
States which possessed weapons of mass destruction to demonstrate, through political 
decisions, their determination to destroy them under United Nations supervision. It had also 
called for the establishment of further nuclear-weapon-free zones in inhabited parts of the 
planet. 
141. In addition, OPANALÂs General Conference had requested the Secretary General of 
OPANAL to consult with representatives of other nuclear-weapon-free zones on the 
possibility of holding an international conference of parties to and other signatories of the 
treaties establishing nuclear-weapon-free zones, the aim being to develop common policies 
regarding nuclear disarmament and action plans for strengthening the international nuclear 
non-proliferation and disarmament regime. The consultations were well under way. 
142. Earlier that month, the participants in a seminar on nuclear-weapon-free zones held in 
Uppsala, Sweden, had - in the ÂUppsala DeclarationÂ - expressed support for the holding of 
an international conference of the type which OPANALÂs General Conference had had in 
mind. He would welcome the participation of the AgencyÂs Secretariat in the planning and 
conduct of the conference - as a sign of the close link between the nuclear-weapon-free zone 
treaties, the AgencyÂs safeguards system and the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. 
143. Mr. PALACIOS (Secretary of the Brazilian-Argentine Agency for Accounting 
and Control of Nuclear Materials) said that during the years since the establishment of 
ABACC a really effective regional system for the application of safeguards to all nuclear 
facilities in Argentina and Brazil had been built up. 
144. Co-operation between ABACC and the Agency within the framework of the 
Quadripartite Agreement was becoming closer and closer. For example, during the past year 
20 facility attachments had been approved, bringing the number of facilities with such 
documents in force to 30, as had procedures for the joint use of equipment at virtually all 
facilities. 


1 See document GC(44)/OR.1, para. 57. 


145. ABACC had - together with Argentina and Brazil - initiated talks with the Agency 
regarding the conclusion of a Protocol additional to the safeguards agreement between 
Argentina, Brazil, ABACC and the Agency. It was continuing to co-operate with 
EURATOM and the United States Department of Energy, and it had recently concluded a co-
operation agreement with the Korean Atomic Energy Institute of the Republic of Korea. 
146. Expressing support for the SecretariatÂs safeguards integration efforts, he said that the 
transparency resulting from the implementation of integrated safeguards would enable the 
Agency to make full use of regional safeguards systems.

GENERAL DEBATE AND ANNUAL REPORT FOR 1999 (continued) 

(GC(44)/4) 

1. Ms. FERRERO-WALDNER (Austria) said that the number of serious incidents 
that had occurred in recent years illustrated the high risks associated with nuclear 
installations, especially power plants. Maximum levels of nuclear safety should therefore be 
maintained throughout the world at all stages of the nuclear fuel cycle. States engaged in 
nuclear activities bore a special responsibility not only to their own citizens but also to those 
of other countries, especially their neighbours. Austria viewed nuclear safety as a key issue 
in the negotiations on the enlargement of the European Union; safety levels in candidate 
countries should correspond to the technical, regulatory and operational state of the art in the 
Union. She asked the Agency for assistance in ensuring that the highest safety standards were 
observed and that an environmental impact assessment was carried out at the Temelin nuclear 
power plant in the Czech Republic. 
2. She was pleased that INSAG was scrutinizing the safety implications of the early 
closure of a number of reactors of Soviet design. The period between the closure decision 
and the beginning of decommissioning was particularly sensitive. The problems that some 
countries were experiencing with the early decommissioning of non-upgradable nuclear 
power plants indicated that the provisions for decommissioning and radioactive waste 
disposal were inadequate. She encouraged the Agency to pursue that issue with 
determination and to keep Member States informed. 
3. Austria appreciated the AgencyÂs efforts to promote an effective worldwide safety 
regime comprising international treaties, internationally accepted standards and measures to 
assist States in their implementation. The Agency should perhaps be entrusted with similar 
responsibilities in the area of safety to those it discharged in the area of safeguards. She 
stressed the importance of the Convention on Nuclear Safety and the Joint Convention, and 
their review proceedings. Austria hoped to complete the process of ratification of the Joint 
Convention that year and she was pleased to note that only three further ratifications were 
needed for its entry into force. Welcoming the focus in that yearÂs Scientific Forum on 
radioactive waste management, she expressed the hope that it would lead to the creation of a 
multi-stakeholder forum in which experts and the general public could share their views and 
concerns. 
4. Austria was seriously concerned about the increasing age of research reactors and the 
large number that had been shut down but not yet decommissioned or placed under the 
control of regulatory authorities. It urged the Agency to give priority to the question of the 
elaboration of a legal instrument on the safety of nuclear research reactors, perhaps as a 
protocol to the Convention on Nuclear Safety. 
5. Austria did not consider nuclear power to be compatible with the concept of sustainable 
development or a viable means of combating the greenhouse effect. Sustainable development 
called for substantial increases in energy efficiency and a switch to renewable sources of 
energy. Aspects such as the participation of civil society in decision-making, radiological 



impacts, human capital and cost-effectiveness should also be taken into account. High-level 
nuclear waste could remain hazardous for thousands of years; that prevented future 
generations from making their own choices and ran counter to the definition of sustainable 
development. 
6. The 2000 NPT Review Conference had reaffirmed the central role of the AgencyÂs 
safeguards system in the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons. Austria supported efforts to 
strengthen the regime and welcomed the gradual implementation of the integrated safeguards 
system, which would allow the Agency do draw well-founded conclusions about the non-
diversion of declared nuclear material and the absence of undeclared nuclear activities. Its 
success would depend to a large extent on the number of countries, especially those with 
significant nuclear activities, that signed additional protocols. Austria reiterated its appeal to 
all States that had not yet done so to conclude safeguards agreements and additional protocols 
with the Agency. 
7. The reduction of nuclear stocks, as envisaged in the final document of the 2000 NPT 
Review Conference, could present the Agency with new challenges, particularly in respect of 
the limitation and control of access to fissile material. She hoped that the Conference on 
Disarmament would soon begin negotiations on a fissile material cut-off treaty and invite the 
Agency to assist in developing the corresponding verification system. 
8. She encouraged the Agency to continue playing a pivotal role in co-ordinating 
international efforts to increase the security of nuclear materials and radioactive sources. As 
protection against unauthorized access was clearly the most effective way of combating illicit 
trafficking, it was essential to put in place effective national physical protection systems 
based on international norms. Austria was an active participant in the discussions on a 
possible revision of the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material and was in 
favour of broadening its scope to cover, inter alia, the use, storage and transport of nuclear 
material within countries. 
9. The 2000 NPT Review Conference had stressed the importance of the AgencyÂs 
technical co-operation activities, a view that Austria fully endorsed. While remaining 
sceptical about the future role of nuclear power, Austria supported the AgencyÂs promotion of 
non-power applications of nuclear energy, especially in the areas of health, hydrology and the 
environment, and would continue to pay its full share of the TCF target figure. 
10. While Austria appreciated the SecretariatÂs efforts to achieve further budgetary savings, 
it realized that the AgencyÂs ongoing and future commitments placed a strain on the limited 
resources available; the Agency needed a budget commensurate with additional needs, 
especially in the safeguards area. She welcomed the agreement reached by the Board of 
Governors on the future financing of safeguards and technical co-operation and hoped that the 
same spirit of compromise would prevail in future discussions of the AgencyÂs budget. She 
assured the Director General of AustriaÂs full support in meeting whatever challenges the 
future held. 


Mr. Buttigieg Scicluna (Malta) took the Chair. 


11. Mr. BADDOU (Morocco) said nuclear energy faced major challenges in the new 
millennium. Its expansion would be rapid, especially in the developing countries with their 
growing needs in energy and potable water, yet never before had it been the object of such 
trenchant criticism, weak political support and public scepticism. The current session offered 
a chance for careful review of the Agency's activities against the backdrop of controversy 
over its priorities, future directions and allocation of resources. 
12. The 2000 NPT Review Conference had confirmed the Treaty as the cornerstone of the 
non-proliferation regime, of which the Agency's safeguards system was an essential 
instrument. Morocco had been one of the first countries to ratify the NPT and to conclude a 
comprehensive safeguards agreement; also, it had ratified the CTBT in May 2000, it had 
supported the Agency's efforts to strengthen the safeguards regime through the additional 
protocol and had signed the Pelindaba Treaty. 
13. In contrast to the Arab States, Israel persisted in its refusal to sign the NPT and submit 
its installations to Agency safeguards. The conclusion of comprehensive safeguards 
agreements by all the States in the Middle East, including Israel, would contribute to 
confidence-building within the region and facilitate the establishment of a NWFZ. Morocco 
was confident that the situation would improve in the near future. 
14. The time had come to put in place an integrated mechanism for nuclear safety 
comprising binding legal instruments and rigorous standards that were regularly brought up to 
date. International and regional co-operation were essential in such domains as nuclear 
safety, radiation protection and radioactive waste management. The early entry into force of 
the Joint Convention would reinforce the international legal regime in that regard. 
15. It was chiefly by establishing training institutions with adequate human and technical 
resources and subregional servicing capacity that lasting results in nuclear safety would be 
achieved. His country was ready to offer two national centres to serve as centres of 
excellence in sub-Saharan Africa and to provide post-graduate instruction in radiation 
protection for participants from French-speaking countries. Existing conventions on the safe 
transport of nuclear materials must be respected and transit countries, of which Morocco was 
one, must be notified of shipments so that governments could guard against threats to the 
population and the environment. 
16. Morocco consistently paid in full its share of the target for voluntary contributions to 
the TCF and contributed actively to activities carried out under AFRA. While it supported 
the Agency's technical co-operation strategy and was satisfied with its activities, it would like 
to see a qualitative evaluation of the results as a supplement to the quantitative data provided. 
A more practical approach to technical co-operation would ensure that it had a real impact on 
the lives of countless people in fields such as nuclear desalination. 
17. The recent discussions on the financing of the AgencyÂs technical co-operation 
activities had shown that the Agency stood at a crossroads. In his delegationÂs view, Member 
States were having to choose between an organization that was concerning itself more and 



more with safeguards and less and less with technical co-operation, or one that fostered 
peaceful development throughout the world, fulfilling its dual mandate for nuclear non-
proliferation and the promotion of peaceful uses of atomic energy. Morocco believed the 
Agency would help to inaugurate a new world atomic order in which access to the benefits of 
nuclear technology was democratic and where safeguards were reinforced and applied in a 
universal and equitable manner. 
18. In conclusion, he said that his country had deposited its instrument of acceptance of the 
amendment to Article VI of the Agency's Statute. 
19. Mr. GARCIA (Philippines) joined previous speakers who had noted the urgency 
of achieving universal adherence to the NPT and its implementing instruments. His 
delegation welcomed the comprehensive safeguards agreements and additional protocols, 
including that of Cambodia, that had been signed since the previous General Conference and 
once again called on all NPT States Parties that had not yet done so to conclude, and bring 
into force, safeguards agreements with the Agency. Also, he urged the Secretariat to increase 
its efforts to conclude additional protocols and to develop integrated safeguards approaches 
for different facilities. 
20. In reaffirming its commitment to the NPT, his country reaffirmed the responsibilities 
the Treaty placed on nuclear and non-nuclear weapon States. In his countryÂs view, the 
former had a special responsibility that should be reflected in their safeguards undertakings. 
His delegation was disappointed that the proposed revised arrangements for financing 
safeguards considered only a countryÂs capacity to pay, and also that no weight was attached 
to membership of the AgencyÂs Board of Governors. 
21. His delegation supported the 2000 NPT Review ConferenceÂs confirmation of the 
central role played by the Agency in developing peaceful applications of nuclear energy and 
welcomed the SecretariatÂs continuing endeavours to strengthen technical co-operation. He 
hoped that improved programme quality and management would encourage greater donations 
from major contributors. 
22. For its part, the Philippines appreciated the technical assistance it received from the 
Agency and was proud of its successes under the Partners in Development concept. In 
agriculture and industry, nuclear applications introduced through technical co-operation 
projects, were acquiring commercial value. The Departments of Agriculture and of Science 
and Technology had approved a three-year sterile insect technique programme to establish a 
fruit fly free zone on the mango-producing Island of Guimaras. More ambitiously, a large-
scale, commercial cobalt-60 irradiation facility was to be established, partly through private 
funding, to meet increasing local demand for the sterilization and decontamination of medical 
and food products. Agency technical assistance would be required, particularly in the initial 
loading of the source. 
23. In the realm of public health, nuclear techniques were being used in the Philippines to 
assess air pollution and Âred tideÂ contamination in coastal areas. With regard to the latter, 
the effective assay technology that had been developed was being shared with other RCA 



Member States through training programmes hosted by the Philippines. With a view to 
building predictive capacity, extension of the technical co-operation project in the Âred tideÂ 
phenomenon in 2001-2002 was being sought. Further progress in the field included the 
development, as part of a CRP, of cheap, non-allergenic, sterile hydrogels, derived from 
carageenan using radiation techniques, as a possible substitute for hydrocolloids in the 
treatment of burn patients. 
24. Among its regional sustainable development activities, the Philippines was the lead 
country in a regional project on isotope use in managing and protecting drinking water and 
planned to hold a workshop on geochemical modelling for water resource assessment and 
management in October 2000. 
25. His delegation shared the hopes expressed by the Director General in his statement the 
previous day about achieving the global objectives of freedom from fear and from want and 
also his confidence in the AgencyÂs contribution to making the world safer and more humane. 
26. Ms. MÃLLER (Germany) said that her Government, having decided to phase out 
nuclear energy, was now preparing a sustainable energy policy geared to renewable energy 
sources, energy conservation and greater efficiency at non-nuclear power plants. Since the 
30% share of GermanyÂs electricity supply generated by nuclear power plants could hardly be 
replaced immediately, the Federal Government had agreed with the four major German 
utilities on a schedule for closing down the 19 plants currently in operation. A ceiling had 
been set for the amount of electricity to be generated by each reactor on the basis of an overall 
lifetime of 32 years. Transportation to reprocessing plants would cease on 1 July 2005, after 
which only direct disposal of spent fuel would be permitted. Work on the Gorleben final 
repository would be interrupted for between 3 and 10 years to clarify design and safety-
related matters. It had been agreed that the utilities would build intermediate storage facilities 
as quickly as possible near the reactor sites. 
27. Despite its decision to stop producing nuclear power, Germany still viewed the 
AgencyÂs work in safeguards, nuclear safety and technical co-operation as indispensable. 
With regard to universal nuclear verification, which her Government considered to be the 
AgencyÂs most important task, the 2000 NPT Review Conference had again highlighted the 
importance of the AgencyÂs safeguards in maintaining public confidence in nuclear non-
proliferation. The conclusion of additional protocols would further increase confidence in the 
safeguards system, but only if all Member States participated. 
28. The verification of weapon-origin material represented a new challenge for the Agency. 
Germany subscribed to the view that the verification methods must be applied on a continuing 
and irrevocable basis, and believed that they should be financed from a mandatory fund, with 
a greater financial share being contributed by the nuclear weapons states which had produced 
the fissile materials in question. 
29. The Agency remained the most important forum in the field of nuclear safety. The first 
review conference of the Nuclear Safety Convention had heightened nuclear safety awareness 



worldwide, and the national reporting and review process had increased transparency at both 
national and international levels. Germany was confident that the second review conference 
in 2002 would make further important contributions. 
30. In conclusion, she said that Germany was confident of the AgencyÂs ability to continue 
fulfilling its mission on behalf of mankind, in particular by guaranteeing the peaceful use of 
the fissile material under its control, offering an important forum for the definition of 
worldwide safety standards, and providing objective information on all aspects of nuclear 
technology. 
31. Mr. FRANK (Israel) commended the Secretariat on choosing radioactive waste 
management as the theme for that yearÂs Scientific Forum. Experts agreed that high-level 
waste and spent fuel could be safely isolated in certain types of deep geologic repositories. 
Provision was also being made for the possibility of retrievable disposal through reprocessing 
or repackaging of waste. An Agency-sponsored international symposium in 1999 had 
confirmed the existence of technologies for the safe, environmentally sound and cost-
effective management of radioactive waste. The Agency should play an educational role in 
that regard by stimulating technical and scientific discussion so as to lay a factual basis for 
national decision-making. 
32. A regional project for the promotion of co-operation in the peaceful use of nuclear 
technology had been initiated in the Middle East under the technical co-operation programme. 
It was designed to enhance the peace process by building confidence through the promotion 
of scientific and technical co-operation among the countries of the region and to address 
common problems such as water resource management, environmental, human health, 
agriculture and geological issues. He thanked the Department of Technical Co-operation for 
its support in that regard and looked forward to enhancing technical co-operation with Jordan, 
Egypt and the Palestinian Authority. 
33. Israel welcomed the AgencyÂs efforts to combat illicit trafficking in nuclear and other 
radioactive materials by improving international standards for physical protection, providing 
training and assistance, and promoting exchanges of information among Member States. The 
Israeli Government was finalizing the process of ratification of the Convention on the 
Physical Protection of Nuclear Material. Universal implementation of that Convention could 
assist in curbing the proliferation of nuclear weapons and materials, support the struggle 
against illicit trafficking and contribute to the overall safety of nuclear materials and facilities. 
Israel hoped that its neighbouring countries would soon accede to the Convention also. 
34. Given the prediction of a major global increase in carbon dioxide emissions, two thirds 
of which would be attributable to the use of fossil fuel by developing countries to meet 
expanding energy demand, there was a growing awareness that only nuclear power could help 
achieve the emissions target agreed in the Kyoto Protocol and prevent climate change. 
Rational assessments by prestigious international organizations indicated that nuclear 
generation, far from being the problem in environmental terms, was in fact a key element in 
the solution. However, safety, economic competitiveness and public acceptance were crucial 
issues that would have to be addressed before there could be any resurgence of nuclear power. 



35. Using nuclear power while ruling out the option of fuel cycle infrastructure and 
activities, including fuel production and reprocessing, could appreciably reduce proliferation 
risks. The Agency could also promote R&D efforts for safer, more competitive and more 
proliferation-resistant nuclear power designs. Advanced technologies such as HTGRs and 
thorium-based reactors with long-life cores could have considerable potential, especially if 
their safeguards effectiveness was demonstrated. 
36. Two draft resolutions submitted to the General Conference were extraneous to the 
Agency Statute and mission and should be viewed in their proper Middle East context. Over 
the past year, the Government of Israel had shown courage, creativity and flexibility in its 
efforts to achieve a comprehensive peace in the region. Nevertheless, the road ahead was 
long and arduous and all parties should show the good will and restraint required to create a 
climate of trust conducive to progress. There were still States in the region that opposed the 
peace process, denied IsraelÂs right to exist and sought to impede the peace process by means 
of terror and violence, either directly or through proxies. Action on divisive draft resolutions 
was counterproductive since it undermined dialogue and reduced IsraelÂs confidence in 
international organizations and norms. 
37. Although Israel had serious reservations about the draft resolution on the ÂApplication 
of IAEA safeguards in the Middle EastÂ and had formally distanced itself from its modalities, 
it was firmly committed to the establishment of a NWFZ in the proper context and at the right 
time and could join a consensus. Nuclear issues such as disarmament and non-proliferation 
could not be divorced from the overall framework needed to bring about peace, reconciliation 
and security in the region through a patient confidence-building process. Nothing was gained 
by harassing or ostracizing those who required time to ensure that their core security interests 
would not be compromised. Formal NPT commitments, even when coupled with Agency 
safeguards, did not in themselves provide adequate guarantees of compliance. 
38. Agenda item 23 entitled ÂIsraeli nuclear capabilities and threatÂ had first been 
introduced by Iraq, whose credentials in the area of weapons of mass destruction were well 
recognized. None of the dangerous proliferation developments in the Middle East in recent 
years had involved Israel, which had neither threatened its neighbours nor acted in defiance of 
international norms. Yet IsraelÂs conduct and the peace process were ignored. Provocation 
and attempts at political harassment were incompatible with the co-operation required for a 
consensus resolution on the application of safeguards in the Middle East. He therefore urged 
all Member States to oppose agenda item 23. 
39. Israel looked forward to working with the Agency on promoting regional co-operation 
in the peaceful applications of nuclear energy. It hoped that the peace process in the Middle 
East would move forward in the months ahead and that true reconciliation, mutual security 
and economic growth would overcome old fears and animosities. 
40. Mr. HUGHES (Australia) said that the Agency was one of the central pillars of 
the nuclear non-proliferation regime, the cornerstone of which was the NPT. As had been 
expected, the 2000 NPT Review Conference had been a landmark event and it had also 



strongly endorsed the role of the Agency. Its momentum should be sustained through the 
AgencyÂs vigorous pursuit of those outcomes relevant to its work. 
41. On the subject of international arms control, Australia welcomed the progress towards 
the implementation of CTBT verification and the certification of the first international 
monitoring stations. His country had been working hard for the early entry into force of the 
CTBT and had been lobbying not only countries in the Asia-Pacific region but also members 
of the group of 44 countries, whose ratification was required for entry-into-force, which had 
not yet acceded to the Treaty. Also, it was regrettable that the Conference on Disarmament 
had been unable to agree on a work programme for the commencement of negotiations on a 
fissile material cut-off treaty. 
42. There was a continuing need to remain vigilant in looking for clandestine nuclear 
weapons programmes and in maintaining pressure on States that the Agency deemed not to be 
in full compliance with their obligations. Australia was concerned that Iraq might take 
advantage of the cessation of the inspections under Security Council resolution 687 to 
reactivate its nuclear weapons programme and welcomed the AgencyÂs commitment to 
resuming verification in Iraq as soon as circumstances permitted. 
43. Turning to the DPRK, he welcomed the Agreed Framework and the progress that had 
been achieved through KEDO. His country had contributed 15.9 million Australian dollars to 
KEDO for the purchase of heavy fuel oil to help meet the DPRKÂs energy needs pending the 
commissioning of the LWRs. Australia had normalized its relations with the DPRK in May 
and welcomed the DPRKÂs engagement with others in the region. The single Korean team 
that had been entered into the Sydney Olympics had marked another major step towards a 
new era on the Korean Peninsula, and he hoped for a rapid resumption of the DPRKÂs full 
co-operation with the Agency so that the Agency could discharge all its responsibilities under 
the NPT and the Agreed Framework. Australia remained concerned at the DPRKÂs continued 
non-compliance with its safeguards agreement and trusted that the DPRK would preserve all 
the information required by the Agency for verification of its initial inventory. 
44. The strengthening of safeguards was a priority objective. Australia, the first State to 
sign and bring into force an additional protocol, urged universal adherence to additional 
protocols. It was participating actively in the AgencyÂs ongoing work on integrated 
safeguards and had agreed an arrangement with the Agency for their application. It was very 
pleased that the AgencyÂs SIR for 1999 had concluded that in two States with comprehensive 
safeguards agreements and additional protocols in force (one of which was Australia) there 
was an absence of undeclared nuclear materials and activities. 
45. He expressed satisfaction with the new financing mechanisms for safeguards and 
technical co-operation and looked forward to their adoption by the General Conference. In 
the light of the AgencyÂs recent difficulties, it was even more important for all Member States 
to pay their assessed contributions in full and on time. 
46. The AgencyÂs technical co-operation programme was an important part of nuclear non-
proliferation enabling many countries to derive benefits from nuclear technology in a wide 



variety of areas. For its part, Australia paid its contribution to the TCF on time each year, and 
also contributed on its own account to technology transfer and technical co-operation. 
47. Commitment to internationally accepted standards of nuclear safety and the 
development of a strong nuclear safety culture were key factors in the successful development 
of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. The Convention on Nuclear SafetyÂs review process 
had had a discernible impact on the safety programmes of a number of Contracting Parties. 
He urged all States with existing or planned nuclear power reactors that had not yet acceded 
to the Convention to do so. Greater attention should also be paid to the safety of research 
reactors given the increasing numbers of ageing or inoperative reactors. Also, all States 
should commit themselves to the highest standards in the management of radioactive waste. 
For its part, Australia was currently in the process of ratifying the Joint Convention and had 
been actively involved in consultations on the Code of Conduct on the Safety and Security of 
Radioactive Sources, which should reduce the number of accidents involving such sources. 
48. With regard to the prevention of illicit trafficking in nuclear material, he said that, while 
the secure custody of nuclear material was primarily the responsibility of the State concerned, 
the Agency could make a major contribution to international security by co-ordinating the 
development of national systems for nuclear accountancy and control and physical protection. 
All trade in nuclear material should be conducted in accordance with the safeguards 
requirements of the NPT and the conditions set out in the Convention on the Physical 
Protection of Nuclear Material. Australia would favour the application of appropriate 
physical protection standards to domestic activities, and welcomed the current discussions on 
the possibility of reviewing the Convention. In AustraliaÂs immediate region, countries were 
concerned about the potential harm arising from the maritime transport of nuclear material. 
Despite the good safety record associated with the shipment of nuclear material, coastal States 
had a right to expect shipping States to observe strict safety standards and ensure 
compensation for damage in the event of an accident. His country recognized the need to 
foster a global liability regime and had participated in discussions with States involved in the 
shipment of nuclear material through the South Pacific region to explore ways of addressing 
particular concerns. 
49. Lastly, he reiterated AustraliaÂs endorsement of the AgencyÂs work, and pledged its 
technical, financial and political support in the future. 
50. Ms. DRÃBOVÃ (Czech Republic) expressed satisfaction with the results of the 
2000 NPT Review Conference. As for its own non-proliferation efforts, the Czech Republic 
had signed the additional protocol to its new safeguards agreement on 28 September 1999 and 
the legislative steps required to implement it had already begun. From the start, the Czech 
Republic had supported review of the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear 
Material and welcomed the informal open-ended meeting of experts organized by the Director 
General to discuss that issue. It also welcomed related Agency activities, particularly 
workshops on illicit trafficking in nuclear material and on design basis threats, one of which it 
had hosted in September 1999. The Czech Republic remained ready to organize, in 



co-operation with the Agency, events relating to the physical protection of nuclear materials 
and facilities as well as safeguards implementation. 
51. Her country's new energy policy envisaged future electricity generation using nuclear 
power as it would help to diversify energy sources, decrease carbon dioxide emissions and 
reduce the exploitation of limited fossil fuel deposits. For the Czech Government, the highest 
possible level of nuclear safety and radiation protection was a precondition for nuclear power 
facility operation. To that end, its legislative and regulatory framework for the use of nuclear 
energy and ionizing radiation had been reformed in recent years. The new legislation 
reflected experience gained in the operation of the Dukovany nuclear power plant, current 
international practice, including Agency recommendations, and the latest findings of 
scientific research. 
52. The recent startup of the Temelin nuclear power plant - based on the WWER-1000 
reactor design but extensively modernized - had given rise to much discussion. Each step had 
been preceded by intensive reviews and inspections by the national regulatory authority and 
the Czech Government had also ensured independent review using expert missions organized 
by the Agency. The reports of the two expert missions which had taken place in 
February 2000 had unequivocally stated that the licensing process in the Czech Republic 
followed the world's best practice and that the Temelin plant was ready for startup. All the 
recommendations made by the experts with a view to increasing the safety level had been 
implemented without delay. Another precondition for startup was fulfilment of all the 
Agency's safeguards requirements. New arrangements for implementing safeguards at the 
Temelin and the Dukovany plants had been drawn up in consultation with the Agency. 
53. The Czech RepublicÂs participation in international nuclear safety activities included 
involvement in the review process of the Convention on Nuclear Safety, co-operation with 
OECD/NEA and the working and advisory bodies of the European Commission, bilateral 
contacts and joint projects. She reiterated her countryÂs readiness to maintain a broad 
dialogue on cross-border aspects of the safety of the Temelin power plant. 
54. Over the years, her country had striven to balance its involvement in the AgencyÂs 
technical co-operation programme as both a beneficiary and a donor. At a time of zero real 
budgetary growth, it had been increasing both its voluntary financial contributions to selected 
projects and its assistance in kind and she called on other countries, especially those in the 
region, to consider similar steps. Specifically, it had supported projects in Ukraine and 
Armenia, and interregional Model Projects to strengthen radiation protection infrastructure in 
some Member States. Also, her countryÂs Model Project to build a centre for short-lived 
radiopharmaceutical production for use in cardiological and oncological diagnostics would be 
completed on schedule in 2000. 


Mr. Othman (Syrian Arab Republic) resumed the Chair. 

55. Mr. SHANGULA (Namibia) expressed appreciation for the assistance received 
from the Department of Technical Co-operation, which had made a significant contribution to 
Namibia's main objective of poverty alleviation. In the past year, several expert missions had 



been sent to the country to help in such fields as human health, animal diseases, water 
resources and safeguards. A Country Programme Framework linked to the national 
development strategy had been prepared and Namibia was confident that it would be given 
positive consideration by the Agency. 
56. The Agency's potential was illustrated by the assistance it had given Namibia in the 
following areas: strengthening the capacity for diagnosis of animal diseases, establishment of 
a central radiation therapy unit, improved monitoring of water flow and the introduction of 
isotope hydrology, automatic tracer flow gauging and fertilizer and water resource 
management. An important new project had been developed using nuclear technology for 
monitoring veterinary drug residues in livestock. The aim was to eradicate animal diseases in 
subsistence farming areas to enable farmers to improve the quality of their products and to 
market their animals without restrictions. Furthermore, in the area of human health, Namibia 
supported the Agency's efforts to introduce the use of isotopes for the control of 
communicable diseases, primarily diagnosis of drug resistant malaria and tuberculosis. Also, 
his delegation noted with satisfaction that the Model Project for the improvement of 
regulatory authority infrastructure in Member States had been extended. 
57. His country had assumed the chairmanship of AFRA for one year and believed that the 
Agreement had achieved tangible results in the short period it had existed. He appealed to all 
Member States of AFRA and the Agency to consider funding AFRA projects. 
58. Namibia had signed an additional protocol to its safeguards agreement with the Agency 
on 20 March 2000 and was finalizing the constitutional requirements for its entry into force. 
59. The daunting challenges facing the Agency could be met only if all Member States 
honoured their financial obligations. His delegation viewed with concern the arrears 
accumulated by some Member States. While mindful of the financial constraints faced by all, 
particularly the developing countries, he urged Member States to pay their assessed and 
voluntary contributions on time and in full. Namibia, for its part, had done so and would 
continue to honour its obligations in the future. 
60. Mr. GRÃNBERG (Finland) said that in the rush to use nuclear technology in the 
early days of the nuclear era, little attention had been paid to the limited lifetime and potential 
obsolescence of nuclear installations and radiation sources. The incentive to take care of such 
facilities and any resulting waste material diminished considerably once they were no longer 
useful. A rigorous, forward-looking legislative and regulatory framework for radioactive 
waste management was required to be in place well beforehand. In the previous ten years or 
so, the international community had become increasingly aware of that problem and the result 
had been a shift of emphasis in the AgencyÂs work. The decommissioning of nuclear 
facilities presented particular problems, with regard not only to waste management but also 
maintaining the necessary know-how. 
61. The implementation of the Joint Convention would bring new and important tasks. 
Ensuring the safety of interim storage sites of spent nuclear fuel was increasingly consuming 



Agency resources. While the integrated safeguards system would offer new approaches, more 
work was needed to reconcile safeguards requirements with the demands of long-term safety. 
Because of its strong interest in that area, Finland was involved actively in the multinational 
effort to develop safeguards for the final disposal of spent fuel in geological repositories. 
62. One of the AgencyÂs recent achievements was the Code of Conduct on the Safety and 
Security of Radioactive Sources. The technical co-operation programme could be a vehicle to 
promote the worldwide adoption of the principles set out in the Code. 
63. Work was being carried out in many countries to develop acceptable technical solutions 
for spent fuel management, identify prospective sites and gain public acceptance for their use. 
The approach used in Finland, which had been fairly successful so far, had been to develop a 
technical solution that was not site-specific and then to approach local communities, mainly 
through environmental impact assessment. A political decision would soon be taken in 
Finland on the final disposal of spent fuel, opening the way to further site studies to form the 
basis for decisions on actual site use. 
64. Mr. VAJGL (Slovenia) expressed satisfaction with the outcome of the 2000 NPT 
Review Conference which, he hoped, would give fresh impetus worldwide to the nuclear 
non-proliferation regime. Slovenia had already ratified the CTBT and urged all States to do 
likewise to facilitate its early entry into force. It also endorsed the immediate initiation of 
negotiations for a fissile material cut-off treaty. 
65. Within the non-proliferation regime, the development and implementation of an 
integrated approach to safeguards was of the highest priority. The Parliament of Slovenia had 
ratified the additional protocol to its safeguards agreement with the Agency in July 2000. His 
delegation urged all States which had not yet signed safeguards agreements and additional 
protocols to do so. 
66. Having voluntarily opted for an unshielded regime for financing safeguards, Slovenia 
welcomed the recent compromise solution reached by the Board in favour of gradual 
elimination of the shielding system. 
67. In March 2000, the Slovenian Parliament had adopted legislation to enforce control 
over exports of dual-use equipment, material and technology that could be used for the 
production of nuclear, chemical or biological weapons or ballistic missiles, ammunition or 
explosives. A decree issued in May 2000 contained a list of such items that was identical to 
the export control regime of the European Union. Thus, Slovenia met the measures stipulated 
by the Nuclear Suppliers Group for nuclear non-proliferation. In addition, it had recently 
become a member of the Zangger Committee. 
68. A well established international safety framework with legally binding instruments was 
a precondition to the peaceful use of nuclear energy and an important element of the global 
safety culture. The first review meeting of Contracting Parties to the Convention on Nuclear 
Safety held in 1999 had been of great value for national nuclear safety programmes. His 
country had already ratified the Joint Convention and urged all Member States to do their best 
to facilitate its early entry into force. The Notification and Assistance Conventions had 



already attained global status, but more Member States should adhere to the Convention on 
the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material and the Paris and Vienna Conventions on liability 
so that they could become universal. 
69. Slovenia highly appreciated the Agency's expert services, having made use of them 
since the very start of its nuclear programme. It planned to invite the Agency to carry out 
another OSART mission in 2002. 
70. As always, his country had pledged its full share to the TCF for 2001 and had fulfilled 
its financial obligations towards assessed programme costs for 1999. In the past year, it had 
hosted nine Agency meetings, training courses or workshops, in addition to providing 
on-the-job training and expert services. It supported Agency technical co-operation projects 
which offered ways of resolving common problems through regional co-operation and had 
submitted its project proposals for the 2001-2002 cycle. 
71. The modernization of the KrÂko nuclear power plant had reached completion in 2000. 
Replacement of the steam generators and the supply of a full-scope simulator had been major 
components of the demanding programme, part of which had been carried out under an 
Agency technical co-operation project. The aim was to extend the lifetime of the plant and 
increase its operational safety. 
72. The number of radiological accidents in recent years proved how essential it was to 
develop an adequate national and international capacity for emergency preparedness and 
response. The Agency was performing important work in that area, and Slovenia was 
actively involved in emergency preparedness activities under the AgencyÂs regional project 
on the safety review of research reactor facilities (RER/9/058). 
73. Having played an active role in the deliberations on the amendment of Articles VI 
and XIV.A of the Statute (resolutions GC(43)/RES/19 and GC(43)/RES/8, respectively), 
Slovenia had already ratified both amendments and had deposited its instrument of 
acceptance on 3 April 2000. An early entry into force of those amendments would contribute 
to enhancing the role and efficiency of the Agency. 
74. Ms. HAIRD (United Kingdom) said that the Agency, as the body responsible for 
applying safeguards and ensuring compliance with safeguards agreements under the NPT, had 
a key role to play in implementing the conclusions of the recent NPT Review Conference. 
She urged the 50 or so States that had not yet brought into force comprehensive safeguards 
agreements to do so as soon as possible in fulfilment of their NPT obligations. She 
congratulated the Director General on having submitted additional protocols covering 
54 States, including some with significant nuclear activities, to the Board of Governors for 
approval and noted with satisfaction that 16 of those protocols had come into force. 
However, many States that had not yet concluded and brought into force additional protocols 
and she called on them to do so as soon as possible. The recent enactment of its Nuclear 
Safeguards Act provided the United Kingdom with the necessary domestic powers to bring its 
additional protocol into force and it would do so as soon as possible. In the meantime, it had 



submitted to the Agency voluntary declarations of information under the terms of the 
additional protocol. She was pleased that the Secretariat had found the information helpful in 
testing systems and procedures for the receipt, processing and evaluation of information. 
75. While the SecretariatÂs work on integrated safeguards, with inputs from SAGSI and 
Member States, was impressive, her delegation believed that the development and 
comparative evaluation of alternative proposals for the integration of safeguards measures 
would provide a useful basis for decisions on the acceptability of particular proposals. She 
looked forward to the submission of a more detailed paper to the Board in due course. 
76. The United Kingdom had published its annual figures for holdings of civil plutonium in 
June 2000 and national figures as at 31 December 1999 for holdings of civil high-enriched 
uranium and the amount of depleted, natural and low-enriched uranium in the civil nuclear 
fuel cycle. As part of the effort to be as transparent as possible about the interface between 
civil and military programmes, information on withdrawals of nuclear material from 
safeguards since 1978 had recently been made public. Future withdrawals from safeguards 
would be limited to small quantities of nuclear material unsuitable for explosive purposes and 
information on such withdrawals would also be made public. 
77. The United Kingdom welcomed the BoardÂs decision concerning the oversight of 
neptunium and americium1. It had provided the Agency with information on exports of 
separated neptunium up to the end of 1999 and would provide annual reports on such exports 
in future. It would also be updating information previously provided on exports of separated 
americium. She stressed the importance of co-operation by the relevant States in the 
oversight exercise. 
78. The United Kingdom was grateful for the BoardÂs updates on negotiations involving the 
Russian Federation, the United States of America and the Agency on submission for 
verification of material designated as no longer required for military purposes and looked 
forward to receiving more detailed information in due course. 
79. Her delegation urged Iraq to begin co-operating immediately with the Agency and 
UNMOVIC so that sanctions could be suspended as soon as possible and eventually lifted. 
Also, the United Kingdom was seriously concerned about the continuing refusal of the DPRK 
to co-operate with the Agency and urged it to comply fully with its safeguards agreement as 
soon as possible. It was to be hoped that the progress made since the recent landmark North-
South summit would be reflected in a more positive attitude by the DPRK to arms control 
issues. 
80. The United Kingdom believed that the Agency should give high priority to safety 
standards within the nuclear safety programme and particularly welcomed moves to develop 
fuel cycle safety standards, which would not only assist the Contracting Parties to the Joint 
Convention in meeting the objectives of the Convention but also complement standards 
already in place for nuclear power plants. The Joint Convention represented a major step 
towards ensuring that spent fuel and radioactive waste were managed in ways that achieved 


1 See the annex to document GOV/OR.986. 


high levels of safety and protected individuals, society and the environment from the harmful 
effects of ionizing radiation. The United Kingdom was committed to the aims of that 
Convention and looked forward to participating in the preparatory meeting for the reviews of 
national reports, and in the reviews themselves. 
81. Her country strongly supported the AgencyÂs technical co-operation activities. It had 
paid its full contribution to the target of the TCF for 2000 and had made additional voluntary 
contributions covering specific areas of the AgencyÂs work. She welcomed the agreement 
reached in the Board on the financing of technical co-operation, particularly the mechanism to 
encourage States to increase their contributions to the TCF in line with a progressive rate of 
attainment formula. She urged all States to contribute their share of the TCF target and 
assessed programme costs in full and on time. 
82. For its part, the United Kingdom had completed the necessary parliamentary procedures 
for ratification of the amendments to Articles VI and XIV of the Statute and she called on all 
States to make every effort to ensure their early entry into force. 
83. Welcoming the SecretariatÂs new approach to programme and budgeting, she said her 
country intended to play an active role in determining priorities for the coming biennium. 
She also welcomed the introduction of performance indicators and called on the Secretariat to 
ensure that they were both representative of the AgencyÂs work and measurable. The United 
Kingdom would do its best to provide any information needed to assist the Secretariat in 
measuring its performance. 
84. She was pleased that an MOU between the Agency and the OECD/NEA had been 
elaborated and looked forward to its speedy conclusion. It would help to prevent unnecessary 
duplication of activities and provide access to the results of the NEAÂs work. 
85. In conclusion, she pledged the continuing support of the United Kingdom to the Agency 
activities in the year ahead. 
86. Mr. SIAGE (Syrian Arab Republic) underlined that IsraelÂs nuclear capability 
presented a serious threat to the countries of the Middle East region. Its nuclear policy was 
not motivated by a regional arms race, since all States of the region except Israel had signed 
the NPT and concluded safeguards agreements with the Agency. The Arab States had again 
placed an item entitled ÂIsraeli nuclear capabilities and threatÂ on the agenda to give the 
Agency an opportunity to condemn those capabilities in the light of the NPT. 
87. For the past six years, the General Conference had adopted by consensus a resolution 
entitled ÂApplication of IAEA safeguards in the Middle EastÂ. As a first step towards 
ensuring transparency and building the confidence needed to establish a NWFZ in the Middle 
East, as advocated in operative paragraph 7 of that resolution and in the final document of the 
2000 NPT Review Conference, Israel should accede to the NPT and place its nuclear facilities 
under Agency safeguards. The General Conference should assist in putting international 
pressure on Israel to renounce nuclear weapons as that would move forward the peace process 
and promote security and stability in the Middle East. 



88. The peace process was currently in difficulties because Israel wanted both peace and 
land. The Syrian Arab Republic aspired to a just and comprehensive peace based on United 
Nations resolutions and would therefore be satisfied with nothing less than the recovery of the 
whole of the Golan Heights up to the line of 4 June 1967 and full Palestinian sovereignty over 
Jerusalem. Israel must cease all measures aimed at altering the Arab character of the city and 
perpetuating its illegal occupation. Moreover, the Palestinian refugees must be given the 
opportunity to exercise their right to return to the land that was stolen from them. 
89. He commended the AgencyÂs Department of Technical Co-operation on its work during 
the previous year. He strongly supported its new strategy based on, inter alia, the one-house 
approach, Model Projects, thematic planning and results-based programming, and encouraged 
the Agency to support the adoption of a regional co-operation agreement among the Arab 
States of West Asia. 
90. The stagnation of TCF resources was impeding the implementation of projects in 
certain Member States. He called on States to honour their obligations to the Fund in full and 
on time, particularly major donor countries that had undertaken under the NPT to make the 
necessary financial and human resources available for the AgencyÂs technical co-operation 
activities, and to pay their assessed programme costs. 
91. The Syrian Arab Republic participated in and supported the AgencyÂs training 
programme. For example, the Syrian Atomic Energy Agency, in co-operation with the 
Agency, was pleased to host a number of training courses, including a nine-month regional 
course on radiation protection and radiation safety in Arabic in Damascus. His country was 
also grateful to the Agency for its assistance in disseminating scientific knowledge in Arabic 
and welcomed the bilateral projects being undertaken by the Agency and the Arab Atomic 
Energy Agency. 
92. Mr. de SAMPAIO NUNES (European Commission) said that although over a 
third of the electricity consumed in the European Union was currently generated by nuclear 
power plants, the long-term role of nuclear energy compared with other sources remained 
unclear. 
93. In signing the Kyoto Protocol, the European Community had committed itself to an 8% 
reduction in 1990 greenhouse gas emission levels by 2010. If the share of nuclear energy in 
electricity production were to decline, Europe would be unable to meet that target. It was 
estimated that CO2 emissions could increase by around 10% in 2010 compared with 1990 and 
by 15% in 2020 if, as anticipated, certain safe and competitive nuclear power plants were shut 
down early and there was a major increase in natural gas consumption. Today, Europe was 
divided over the nuclear option, which must be objectively and democratically debated. 
While it presented advantages in terms of economic competitiveness, supply security and 
greenhouse gas reductions, there were still drawbacks in respect of radiation safety, the 
dismantling of obsolete facilities and the management of highly radioactive wastes. 
94. Expansion of the EU to include central and eastern European countries raised the issue 
of reactor safety in some candidate countries. The Union had taken due note of the Director 



General's offer to work more closely with it on the matter. First-generation Soviet-type 
reactors that could not be brought up to western safety levels at a reasonable cost were to be 
closed, and politically binding agreements to that end had been concluded with the countries 
concerned. The remaining reactors would be renovated within a reasonable time-frame. The 
EU had established a number of financial mechanisms to help candidate countries attain high 
standards of nuclear safety. It had contributed to the creation of a special fund within the 
EBRD for the early closure of some of the most unsafe reactors and had provided a large loan 
through EURATOM for the modernization of the Kozloduy nuclear power plant in Bulgaria. 
95. In the interests of promoting world economic development while preserving the 
environment, the EU was prepared to share its experience in nuclear safety with countries that 
chose the nuclear option. An important aspect of the European Commission's efforts aimed at 
protecting humankind from the dangers of ionizing radiation was its work to promote a 
nuclear safety culture in Europe. To that end, it was collaborating especially closely with 
Russia, Ukraine and Armenia. The European Commission applauded UkraineÂs decision to 
shut down the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in December 2000. At the donorsÂ conference 
for the rehabilitation of the Shelter, held in Berlin in July 2000, the EU had made pledges 
bringing its contribution to 57% of the total funding. Within its own borders, the EU 
continued to identify aspects of nuclear safety that could be improved by a common approach 
and had encouraged candidates for membership to participate in the effort. An increasingly 
important activity in Europe, in view of the number of facilities which were planned for 
closure, was the dismantling of nuclear installations. 
96. The EU welcomed the success of the recent NPT Review Conference, even though a 
number of difficult issues remained unresolved. The control of nuclear materials within the 
Union remained entirely satisfactory, largely due to the excellent co-operation between 
Agency inspectors and those of the European Commission, and especially through the New 
Partnership Approach. The Commission actively supported the Agency in the development 
of integrated safeguards which would favour a more qualitative approach to control and 
should lead to reductions in traditional activities. He hoped that the EU would continue to be 
an area where nuclear proliferation was not an issue so that the Agency could concentrate its 
safeguards efforts on areas where real dangers existed. The Commission played an important 
role in the supply of nuclear fuels and monitored markets closely to ensure diversification of 
sources of supply. 
97. If there was to be a future for nuclear energy, R&D in both fission and fusion was 
important in order to make existing technology safer and more economical through the 
exploration of new and promising concepts. With regard to fission, a high priority should be 
given the problem of waste management, whereas the main issue for fusion was clearly the 
future of the ITER. Negotiations on co-operation agreements in fusion research between 
EURATOM and the United States of America and EURATOM and Kazakhstan had been 
completed in April 2000 and June 2000, respectively. Progress had been made in negotiating 
a co-operation agreement on peaceful uses of nuclear energy with Japan and similar 
negotiations would be launched very soon with Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. 
Co-operation agreements on nuclear safety and fusion had been negotiated with the Russian 



Federation and were to be signed in the near future, and specific nuclear co-operation 
activities had been carried out with that country, including the involvement of the 
EURATOM Joint Research Centre. The EU intended to remain involved in KEDO and in 
any initiative aimed at the maintenance of peace and the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons 
on the Korean Peninsula. 
98. In conclusion, he said that all States, including those of the EU, would have to face 
challenges in the nuclear sector in coming years. The Commission must not confine itself to 
the role of administrator of decisions adopted within its institutional framework; it should 
initiate a wide-ranging debate on the share of nuclear power in Europe's future energy supply.

GENERAL DEBATE AND ANNUAL REPORT FOR 1999 (continued) 

(GC(44)/4) 

1. Mr. RAMAKER (Netherlands), after welcoming Azerbaijan, Tajikistan and the 
Central African Republic to membership of the Agency, said that the most important 
development in the past year had been the successful outcome of the NPT Review 
Conference. The fact that all the parties to the Treaty had produced a consensus document 
addressing all aspects of nuclear policy could not fail to exert a positive impact on the 
AgencyÂs work. 
2. Having signed its additional protocol two years previously together with its European 
partners, and having ratified it in the meantime, the Netherlands welcomed the steady growth 
in the number of additional protocols concluded. At the same time, considering a strong 
non-proliferation regime to be a major factor in establishing global peace, security and 
stability, the Netherlands shared the Director GeneralÂs concern that the number of States 
which had concluded additional protocols, including those without full-scope safeguards, had 
fallen far short of expectations. A reinforced and integrated safeguards system was essential 
to the AgencyÂs effective and credible functioning, and constituted a main pillar of the 
existing non-proliferation regime. 
3. The Netherlands, regarding the Agency as the custodian of non-proliferation, looked 
forward to its expanding its activities in relation to the verification of nuclear material arising 
from the dismantling of nuclear weapons. The recent decision by the United States and the 
Russian Federation each to convert a further 34 tonnes of weapons-grade plutonium to 
peaceful uses would offer such an opportunity. Given that the cost would be well beyond the 
AgencyÂs current capacity, the two States directly involved would bear a special 
responsibility although other States should be prepared to contribute as well, since the 
conversion of nuclear material to peaceful uses benefited the entire world. 
4. The Netherlands was also concerned at the cash-flow problems the Agency was 
experiencing in its efforts to finance its pivotal role in the field of nuclear safety and technical 
co-operation. The main cause was the increasing backlog in the payment of contributions by 
Member States. He called on those countries which had not met their financial obligations to 
do so in full, unconditionally and without delay. For its part, the Government of the 
Netherlands had decided to provide additional extrabudgetary funds to support the current 
yearÂs safeguards programme. 
5. Turning to the energy situation in his country, he said his GovernmentÂs policy was 
geared to energy conservation, renewable energy sources and market liberalization. One of 
its main objectives was to increase the share of renewables in total primary energy 
consumption from its current level of 1% to 10% by the year 2020. The Netherlands now had 
only one nuclear power plant, at Borssele, which would stay in operation until the end of 
2003. Following an in-depth study of the decommissioning options for the Dodewaard 
reactor which had been closed down in 1997, Parliament had recently selected a policy of 
postponed decommissioning lasting no more than 50 years as being the financially most 
viable option. 



6. Other parts of the nuclear fuel cycle played a significant and successful role in the 
Netherlands economy. One of the major players was Urenco Nederland, which employed 
advanced gas ultracentrifuge technology for uranium enrichment purposes. The company, 
which had recently opened a fifth separation plant at the Almelo site, also used its technology 
in spin-off activities in the aerospace market and performed stable isotope enrichment for 
nuclear and medical applications. 
7. Through the Nuclear Research Group of the Netherlands, his country also operated the 
High Flux Reactor at Petten on behalf of the European Commission. In recent years, a centre 
of excellence had been created around the reactor, which was one of the most powerful 
multi-purpose materials testing facilities in the world. With the focus mainly on medical 
applications, the siteÂs interaction with the pharmaceutical industry, with several hospitals in 
Europe and with numerous international teams had transformed Petten into EuropeÂs 
ÂMedical ValleyÂ. As the major European producer of medical radioisotopes the reactor had 
already benefited millions of patients within and outside Europe. Petten also provided other 
therapeutic treatments such as boron neutron capture therapy, which was currently 
undergoing trials involving brain cancer patients. 
8. In conclusion, he wished the Conference every success, and observed that the potential 
of atomic energy must still be regarded with an appropriate combination of elation and 
caution. 
9. Mr. I.H. UMAR (Nigeria) said his delegation attached great importance to the 
peaceful uses of nuclear science and its applications, which had served as a valuable 
instrument for promoting sustainable development, particularly in developing Member States, 
across a wide range of activities. In Nigeria, the AgencyÂs ongoing projects complemented 
the GovernmentÂs activities in healthcare delivery systems, radiotherapy and oncology, 
nuclear activation analysis, neonatal hypothyroidism screening, monitoring of pesticide 
residues in foodstuffs, cross-breeding of indigenous cattle for milk production, and 
monitoring of workersÂ exposure to environmental hazards. 
10. Despite being a major oil producer, Nigeria acknowledged the advantages of nuclear 
energy and wished to keep that option open. In that regard, his country was deeply grateful to 
the Agency for its valuable assistance in initiating the project to install and operate a 
miniature neutron source reactor. Although its commissioning had been delayed for 
administrative and technical reasons, Nigeria was convinced that they would be resolved in 
due course. Within the framework of the development of an energy master plan for Nigeria, 
the Agency had provided training for two Nigerians under the Energy and Power Evaluation 
Programme. Nigeria hoped for similar contributions to its future efforts to optimize a mixed 
energy policy. As a sign of NigeriaÂs commitment to such programmes, he was pleased to 
announce that his Government had pledged the full amount of its contribution to the TCF. 
11. In the firm belief that the AgencyÂs safeguards system was central to global 
non-proliferation, peace and security, his delegation welcomed the final document of the 
recent NPT Review Conference in which, for the first time, the nuclear-weapon States had 
made an unequivocal commitment to nuclear disarmament. His delegation looked forward to 



that being translated into action, particularly in the light of the continuing existence of 
over 30 000 nuclear warheads, the absence of a timetable for disarmament, the escalation of 
the arms race in outer space, and the slow pace of progress on a fissile material cut-off treaty. 
12. Nigeria had recently signed the African Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone Treaty and the 
Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty and was proceeding with their ratification. Having 
also concluded the additional protocol to its safeguards agreement with the Agency, Nigeria 
noted with regret that the number of States which had done likewise had fallen far below 
expectations, particularly as universal accession was so vitally important to the effectiveness 
of the integrated safeguards system. He called on those countries yet to conclude an 
additional protocol to do so, and confirmed his GovernmentÂs intention to re-examine all the 
disarmament treaties it had not yet signed or ratified with a view to becoming more actively 
involved in them. 
13. Nigeria firmly endorsed the AgencyÂs long-standing objective of establishing 
international standards for protection against the harmful effects of ionizing radiation. Since 
it did not yet have a nuclear regulatory authority, it welcomed the AgencyÂs proposal to 
initiate a new Model Project concerned with the upgrading of radiation protection 
infrastructures. 
14. Turning to the contentious issues of funding for technical co-operation and for 
safeguards, he welcomed the fact that Member States had eventually found sufficient 
common ground to build a consensus. However, it should not be forgotten that the ending of 
the safeguards shielding system had entailed considerable political sacrifice on the part of the 
developing Member States, whose contribution to the safeguards component in the Regular 
Budget had doubled while financing for technical co-operation still remained uncertain 
because of its voluntary nature. The long debate on those two equally important Agency 
activities had been characterized by a spirit of fairness, honesty and transparency that he 
hoped would be maintained. In particular, he urged all Member States to consolidate the 
areas of consensus. The debate had also highlighted the close relationship between the two 
issues, and he called on all Member States to observe fully both their legal obligation to 
contribute to safeguards funding and their moral and political commitment to the TCF. A 
collective effort would also be required to solve the AgencyÂs current cash-flow problem so 
that its programmes could continue to be implemented efficiently and effectively. 
15. In conclusion, he said there were certain fundamental development problems affecting 
his country and region which the Agency had the potential to alleviate. They included 
malaria, whose impact might be reduced if the sterile insect technique would be adapted to 
mosquito control and eradication; the incidence of solid cancer among the developing worldÂs 
growing elderly population, which the Agency could help alleviate by strengthening the 
radiation therapy infrastructure of the Member States concerned; and finally de-mining, 
where nuclear techniques could perhaps be used to locate some of the over 60 million 
abandoned landmines now buried in 62 countries, which were killing or maiming some 26 
000 people every year, 80% of them civilians. 



16. Mr. CHIDAMBARAM (India) read out the following message on behalf of the 
Prime Minister of India, Mr. Atal Bihari Vajpayee: 
ÂWe have emerged from the Millennium Summit of the United Nations with a 
redoubled resolve to work for balanced and sustainable socio-economic development 
for our people. The energy of the atom can be harnessed to further this agenda. 
Nuclear power provides an important and clean energy option for mitigating the energy 
shortfalls in the developing world. Last year, we in India commissioned two modern 
nuclear power reactors, built with indigenous technology and expertise. We have also 
succeeded in increasing the average capacity factor in our nuclear power plants to a 
figure of 80%. Scientific research has uncovered beneficial applications of 
radioisotopes and radiation in agriculture, medicine and industry. 

ÂTogether with ensuring safety and monitoring safeguards, we believe that the IAEA 
has an important role in promoting technological capabilities among its Member States 
for these developmental goals. As a founder member of the Agency, India would 
extend its fullest support to these endeavours. 

ÂI take this opportunity to wish the 44th General Conference of the IAEA all success in 
its deliberations.Â 


17. India believed that under the Statute the main objective of the AgencyÂs activities was 
to accelerate and enlarge the contribution of atomic energy to peace, health and prosperity 
worldwide, and that nuclear safety and safeguards constituted important and necessary 
supporting activities, with technology always the prime consideration. 
18. His delegation endorsed the priority assigned in the Medium Term Strategy to the role 
of nuclear energy in the context of sustainable development, which reflected the 
recommendations of the Scientific Forum held during the previous session of the General 
Conference. His delegation also appreciated the Director GeneralÂs efforts to establish a task 
force on enhancing the role of innovative nuclear reactors and fuel cycles in sustainable 
development. India would like to see such activities incorporated into the AgencyÂs regular 
programme. In the context of nuclear power sustainability, India considered that expert 
discussions on the technical, financial and environmental aspects of the various nuclear fuel 
cycle options could contribute meaningfully to the Medium Term Strategy. Like other 
Member States of the Group of 77, India therefore welcomed the creation of the Nuclear 
Technology Review, its inclusion in the agendas of the Board of Governors and the General 
Conference, and the appointment of standing advisory groups on nuclear energy and on 
nuclear science and applications. 
19. The substantial increase in oil prices and the level of international commitment to the 
Kyoto Protocol meant it was likely that some countries which had seen a slow-down in their 
nuclear power development programmes would reverse their policies. For its part, a country 
as large as India needed to achieve rapid growth in nuclear electricity generation capacity in 
order to satisfy rapidly growing demand. 



20. Given its limited uranium resources and the need to ensure long-term energy security, 
India had opted for a closed nuclear fuel cycle policy based on a fast-breeder reactor 
programme, the use of thorium, and the associated fuel reprocessing and refabrication plants. 
The requisite technological resources derived mainly from a strong R&D programme centred 
around the 15-year-old fast breeder test reactor at Kalpakkam; its unique and indigenously 
developed mixed uranium-plutonium carbide fuel had performed extremely well, reaching a 
maximum burnup of over 53 000 MWÂ·d/t without any failures. Construction of a 500 MW(e) 
prototype fast-breeder reactor was under way. The 233U fuelled Kamini research reactor was 
also operating successfully. The use of a closed fuel cycle had also brought significant 
environmental benefits, since it generated very low amounts of high-level waste. 
21. At the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre, work was proceeding on the design and 
development of an advanced heavy water reactor fuelled by plutonium and uranium-233. The 
reactor, which would incorporate several advanced safety and control features and was 
designed to facilitate thorium utilization, was part of IndiaÂs efforts to develop innovative 
reactor and fuel cycle designs for sustainable nuclear development. For the future, India 
looked towards increased installed capacity based on state-of-the-art thermal and fast reactors, 
with continuing emphasis placed on safety improvement. In that regard, his delegation 
welcomed the recent acknowledgement by RussiaÂs President Putin at the United Nations 
Millennium Summit that the most rapid growth in energy production over the next century 
would occur in the developing countries, and that proliferation-resistant new nuclear 
technologies would need to be developed in order to reduce the ecological damage caused by 
greenhouse gases and to conserve existing fossil fuel reserves for non-electricity uses. The 
Agency, with its worldwide membership encompassing a large number of developing 
Member States, bore a collective responsibility to find technological solutions for such 
problems. 
22. India was also pursuing research in non-grid-based nuclear applications such as 
desalination, process heat generation, and the production of non-fossil fuels and compact 
portable power packs. As a prelude to the larger-scale use of MOX fuel in thermal reactors, 
such fuel had been introduced on a limited basis in the boiling water reactors at Tarapur. 
Performance had been good, and the discharged assemblies were now undergoing post-
irradiation examination. The experience of plutonium recycling gained to date was also 
important in the context of IndiaÂs long-term interest in thorium, which it regarded as 
particularly well suited to large-scale nuclear power deployment. 
23. India also continued to invest in fundamental research, for example in plasma physics, 
and would be pleased to participate, on the basis of its experience, in the international efforts 
to develop fusion power. 
24. Turning to the Memorandum of Understanding signed between the Agency and the 
OECD/NEA, he emphasized that the strengthening of synergies anticipated by the Senior 
Expert Group would only come about in an atmosphere of full transparency. While that 
might happen in the case of specific activities pertaining to areas of common interest and 
co-operation, both agencies were responsible for their own activities, in accordance with their 



own statutory functions, and so it would be desirable not to mention Âsingle Agency 
activitiesÂ in the Memorandum. 
25. With regard to the financing of technical assistance, he said it was vital that all Member 
States should pledge and pay in full, particularly the major donors. Instead, the gap between 
pledges and actual contributions was widening. His country regarded technical co-operation 
funding as a moral obligation, rather than a purely voluntary matter, and therefore always 
pledged in full and paid on time. India would also like the AgencyÂs technical co-operation 
programme to place greater emphasis on the promotion of self-reliance among developing 
Member States so that they became less dependent on the developed countries. 
26. India also wished to see an improvement in the quality of safeguards implementation. 
Great technological advances had taken place since 1971 when the new inspection regime had 
been put in place, and it was time to examine whether the technological progress could not be 
reflected in the quality and quantity of inspection effort, with a corresponding reduction in 
cost. The argument that increased safeguards efforts had to be accommodated automatically 
as they were mandatory requirements under agreements signed in connection with the NPT 
brought into question the differences between statutory and mandatory activities. In that 
regard, since nuclear promotion was a basic statutory objective of the Agency, his delegation 
wondered why only 5.9% of the Regular Budget was allocated for an activity as important as 
nuclear power. 
27. India appreciated the AgencyÂs efforts to prevent illicit trafficking in nuclear materials. 
However, clandestine acquisition of sensitive technology and materials was known to have 
occurred in IndiaÂs region, thus clearly demonstrating that prevention required real 
commitment by Member States. In relation to both physical protection measures and export 
controls, India had an exemplary record that reflected its stringent law-based system. 
28. The stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction held by those that had been the first to 
build up such deadly arsenals remained at alarmingly high levels. India continued to press 
with undiminished commitment for universal, verifiable nuclear disarmament, while 
safeguarding its strategic space and its autonomy in decision-making. International peace 
could not be separated from the need for equal and legitimate security for all. 
29. The beginning of a new millennium was an opportunity to take a fresh look at the role 
of nuclear power. It was time to dispel the publicÂs prejudices and fears about reactor safety 
and the management of long-lived radioactive waste, since technological solutions were now 
available for both of those issues. The AgencyÂs Member States must pool their collective 
wisdom and scientific knowledge in order to maximize the use of nuclear technology in 
addressing the challenges of global development. 
30. Mr. KIENER (Switzerland), speaking also on behalf of Liechtenstein, welcomed 
the adoption by the recent NPT Review Conference of a balanced final declaration. Given the 
disparities that existed in the world nuclear order, and as long as the risk of new horizontal or 
vertical proliferation remained, the international community must spare no effort in that area. 



31. Switzerland was concerned at the imbalance between the lack of progress in achieving 
the objectives of Article VI of the NPT, on the one hand, and the implementation of other 
parts of the Treaty affecting the non-nuclear-weapon States, in particular Articles II and III, 
on the other hand. The decision taken at the 1995 NPT Review Conference to extend the 
Treaty must be translated into a movement towards disarmament, and not simply result in an 
indefinite extension of the status quo to the benefit of the nuclear Powers. 
32. Having recently signed an additional protocol to its safeguards agreement, Switzerland 
looked forward to the establishment of an integrated safeguards system that offered greater 
efficiency based on reduced implementation costs. 
33. The Swiss Parliament had recently ratified the Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent 
Fuel Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management, which Switzerland 
considered to be an essential element in the context of the ongoing efforts to formulate 
framework conditions for international storage of nuclear waste. Switzerland regarded the 
concept as particularly applicable to highly radioactive waste. The countries interested in 
joint storage would need to fulfil certain prior conditions, including the establishment of a 
potential national storage site. SwitzerlandÂs research into high-level waste storage over the 
past year had focused on clay formations. The next stage of that programme would be to 
demonstrate that a viable site for high-level waste disposal existed in Switzerland. 
34. In that context, a group of experts investigating models of radioactive waste 
management had published a report at the beginning of the year concluding that only deep 
geological disposal could satisfy long-term safety requirements, and that a test gallery should 
be drilled on a priority basis at the Wellenberg site, which had been selected for the storage of 
low- and medium-level waste. The opponents of radioactive waste storage in Switzerland had 
welcomed the groupÂs conclusions, thus giving reason to hope that the public debate had 
finally moved on after several years at a stand-still. However, not wanting to weaken their 
political position, those opponents remained reluctant to accept fully the conclusions of the 
expert group study. 
35. Work on the construction of SwitzerlandÂs intermediate nuclear waste storage centre 
had recently been completed, and the Government had authorized its commissioning. 
36. The revision of SwitzerlandÂs law on atomic energy had reached the consultation stage, 
and several different points of view had been communicated to the Government. Issues such 
as limiting the lifetime of nuclear power plants and banning nuclear fuel reprocessing had 
been hotly contested. On the other hand, the idea of keeping the nuclear option open and 
holding a referendum, if requested, on any proposal to build a new power plant had been well 
received. But it was clear that the Swiss population was still divided on nuclear energy. 
37. A year had passed since the resumption of rail transport of spent fuel elements, 
following a stoppage of several months. The Swiss safety authorities reported that the 
measures taken to reduce contamination had been successful and that no excess levels had 
been detected on transports since their resumption. 



38. In conclusion, he assured the Director General of SwitzerlandÂs support for the 
AgencyÂs efforts to provide assured, equitable and predictable funding for technical 
co-operation. As always, Switzerland would pay its full contribution to the TCF. On the 
other hand, Switzerland continued to believe that a budget based on zero nominal growth 
represented the best way forward for the Agency. 
39. Mr. VAITKUS (Lithuania), after welcoming the new members to the Agency and 
associating himself with the statement made on behalf of the European Union and associated 
countries, said that the past year had seen many changes relating to nuclear energy in his 
country. In particular, good results had been achieved in upgrading safety at the Ignalina 
nuclear power plant to bring it in line with international standards. Moreover, Parliament had 
adopted a national energy strategy in October 1999 which provided for a comprehensive 
assessment of the technical, economic and political factors affecting the plantÂs future 
operation. Under the terms and conditions of considerable long-term financial and technical 
assistance offered by the European Union, the G-7 countries, individual States and 
international financial institutions, the decision had been taken to shut down Unit 1 at 
Ignalina by 2005. The action plan for implementing the national energy strategy, which was 
being developed in co-operation with appropriate international institutions, would focus on 
the provision of new electricity resources, including potential ones based on nuclear energy. 
A review of the national energy strategy plan would be conducted in 2004. 
40. During the remaining years of operation of Ignalina Unit 1, adequate safety levels 
would be maintained in accordance with the licence issued by the national regulatory 
authority. All aspects of the decommissioning would be co-ordinated by a commission 
comprising representatives of the organizations concerned. However, as Lithuania did not 
possess the resources to cope with the unusual and complicated problems involved in 
decommissioning an RBMK-type nuclear reactor, especially in areas that called for thorough 
expertise and safety assessments, it hoped for long-term and continuous support from the 
international community, and to that end had recently held an international conference for 
financial donors. He thanked the Agency for attending that event, and for its timely and 
positive response in formulating a technical co-operation project to support the 
decommissioning process. 
41. Since Lithuania did not intend to renounce nuclear energy totally, it welcomed the 
AgencyÂs intention to set up a task force on innovative reactors and fuel cycles. Its electricity 
grid being small, Lithuania was particularly interested in new SMRs. 
42. Lithuania strongly supported the AgencyÂs activities in the sphere of non-proliferation. 
Convinced that the new safeguards measures to be implemented under additional protocols 
would play an important role in the future, Lithuania had recently ratified its additional 
protocol and urged other countries to do likewise as soon as possible. In that context, it also 
welcomed the AgencyÂs efforts to monitor the separation and export of neptunium and 
americium. 
43. Turning to the question of physical protection, he thanked the Agency for the IPPAS 
mission to Lithuania and the assistance rendered in implementing its recommendations. His 



country supported the calls for discussions on a revision of the Convention on the Physical 
Protection of Nuclear Material and hoped that a common approach to the physical protection 
of nuclear materials and facilities would be arrived at. 
44. His Government fully recognized the importance of export controls as a means of 
curbing nuclear proliferation and had recently adopted resolutions following the guidelines of 
the Nuclear Suppliers Group with regard to international transfers of nuclear material, 
equipment and technology and dual-use equipment, materials, software and related 
technology. 
45. Another important example of LithuaniaÂs adapting national legislation to 
internationally accepted principles had been its ratification of the Convention on Assistance in 
the Case of a Nuclear Accident or Radiological Emergency earlier in the year. 
46. The AgencyÂs valuable assistance under the technical co-operation programme in recent 
years had enabled Lithuania to make significant progress in the areas of radiation source 
management, nuclear medicine, radiotherapy, nuclear power planning and training of nuclear 
power plant personnel. The number of specialists from Member States undergoing training in 
Lithuania was also increasing steadily and he was pleased to announce that Lithuania was 
able to pledge a voluntary contribution for the year 2001. 
47. Finally, he wished to mention that the participation by representatives of LithuaniaÂs 
regulatory authorities and nuclear facilities in the NEAÂs ISOE programme had led to 
reductions in occupational exposure levels. He looked forward to further participation in that 
programme, which would help strengthen decision-making in his country in the area of 
radiation protection and nuclear safety. 
48. Mr. AHMAD (Pakistan) said his country had always pursued the goals of 
non-proliferation and disarmament with sincerity. Only security fears resulting from the 
nuclear tests conducted in its neighbourhood in 1998 had forced Pakistan to demonstrate its 
nuclear capability. Having conducted its nuclear tests for the sake of peace and stability in 
South Asia, Pakistan was determined not to enter into an arms race, and would act with 
utmost restraint in maintaining its nuclear deterrent at the minimum possible level. It had 
now declared a unilateral moratorium on nuclear testing, and attempts were under way to 
build a national consensus on accession to the CTBT. Pakistan had also taken concrete steps 
with regard to the export of sensitive nuclear technology. 
49. Nuclear power was the means by which nuclear technology achieved its greatest impact 
on socio-economic development. Against the global trend, nuclear power was on the increase 
in Asia, which looked set to become the future repository of nuclear power expertise. Nuclear 
power would have developed even faster in Asia had technology transfer not been blocked, 
even in cases affecting the safety of installations and at facilities under Agency safeguards. 
As a country with low fossil-fuel reserves, Pakistan had no alternative but to look to nuclear 
power, and it was grateful to China for supplying the 300 MW(e) Chashma plant, which was 
now fully operational, and to the Agency for helping to assess the plantÂs safety features 
through pre-OSART and other missions. 



50. Pakistan welcomed the holding of scientific forums concurrently with the General 
Conference and considered the current one, on radioactive waste management, highly relevant 
in the context of public fears about the safety of nuclear power and waste disposal 
technology. Similarly, the scientific forum held the previous year had highlighted many 
important issues and had led to the establishment of the task force on innovative reactors and 
fuel cycles which Pakistan hoped would attract as broad a membership as possible. 
51. In the face of an alarming increase in greenhouse gas emissions and growing evidence 
of global warming, nuclear power was the only existing replacement for coal. Although the 
amount of reactor operating experience accumulated worldwide and the increased stability, 
safety and economy of new reactor designs made nuclear power a viable, competitive and 
climate-friendly energy source, it had regrettably not been included in the Clean Development 
Mechanism. The Agency, as the only inter-governmental body dedicated to nuclear science 
and technology, therefore bore a heavy responsibility for developing a consensus among its 
Member States on the importance of nuclear power in the climate change scenario. 
52. Now that the Convention on Nuclear Safety had been widely ratified, the Agency, 
which had already done so much to improve safety culture within the global nuclear 
community, should endeavour to provide the parties to the Convention with more co-
operation and information relating to power reactor safety. 
53. Pakistan endorsed the AgencyÂs activities in the field of safeguards and looked forward 
to the introduction of an efficient and cost-effective integrated system. The safeguards on 
PakistanÂs installations were operating to the AgencyÂs satisfaction, and Pakistan had recently 
agreed to several proposals for further improvements, as well as acceding to the Convention 
on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Materials. 
54. Since supplies of fresh water would become increasingly scarce during the next century 
because of increasing population and industrialization, Pakistan urged the Agency to step up 
its efforts to promote nuclear techniques for the development and management of water 
resources for human, agricultural and industrial consumption. 
55. He commended the Agency on its work to enhance food security based on specialized 
isotope and radiation techniques, which had led to an increase in cotton production and a 
surplus in wheat production in Pakistan. 
56. The Abdus Salam International Centre for Theoretical Physics at Trieste had done much 
to promote scientific knowledge in developing countries, despite a meagre budget. Pakistan 
hoped that the Agency would continue to support the Centre and also revive its interest in its 
management. 
57. He congratulated the Department of Technical Co-operation on the consistently high 
implementation rate achieved over successive years, and welcomed the fact that the Agency 
had accepted a number of SAGTACÂs recommendations for enhancing the efficiency and 
usefulness of its technical co-operation activities. Pakistan had benefited greatly from such 
activities, and attempted for its part to contribute to them by providing training and expert 
services and facilities. In addition, he was pleased to announce that once again his 



Government was able to pledge its full share of the TCF target. He also noted with 
gratification the agreement achieved on enhanced rates of attainment for contributions to the 
TCF and trusted it would lead to an acceleration of the AgencyÂs technical co-operation 
activities. 
58. The AgencyÂs overall technical programme was endorsed by Member States in view of 
its importance and usefulness, but nevertheless its successful continuation depended on the 
provision of adequate resources. Unfortunately, for almost two decades the AgencyÂs 
priorities had been inverted, with its technical programme subject to the artificial constraints 
of a zero-real-growth budget. It was time for delegations to devote fresh thought to the 
development of a programme-driven budget. 
59. Recent developments in Pakistan with regard to the peaceful applications of nuclear 
energy included the successful commissioning of the Chashma nuclear power plant and the 
determined efforts which had been made to ensure the safe operation of the ageing Karachi 
plant. In agriculture, PakistanÂs research institutes had developed and made available 
35 varieties of cash crop and the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC) in particular 
was providing assistance in that area through the Agency to seven other developing countries. 
The PAEC had also continued to promote quality consciousness in local industry, and it had 
set up an isotope hydrology laboratory concerned mainly with the identification of 
underground water resources. In the area of human health, the PAEC had so far established 
twelve medical centres in all four of PakistanÂs provinces offering specialized services in the 
fields of nuclear medicine, radiotherapy, oncology and RIA. Pakistan was also keeping 
abreast of developments in genetics through its Nuclear Institute for Biotechnology and 
Genetic Engineering, and it was particularly interested in collaborating with the Agency in 
applying information technology in the nuclear field. 
60. In conclusion, he expressed appreciation of the AgencyÂs efforts to keep its technical 
programme under continuing evaluation through the formation of standing advisory groups on 
nuclear applications and on nuclear energy, noting however that the recommendations of 
other groups such as SAGTAC and the Senior Expert Group had not yet been fully 
implemented, and that there appeared to be some overlap in the mandate of the various 
groups. 
61. Ms. AL-MULLA (Kuwait), after welcoming the new Members, Tajikistan, 
Azerbaijan and the Central African Republic, said that one of the AgencyÂs functions, 
according to its Statute, was to encourage research on and practical application of atomic 
energy for peaceful uses throughout the world. Kuwait supported that role, particularly the 
AgencyÂs promotion of comprehensive development plans in Member States and the use of 
nuclear technology in the areas of food security, agriculture, health and water resources. 
KuwaitÂs support for the AgencyÂs technical development co-operation programme was 
reflected in its voluntary contribution for the year 2000. It was pleased that the Member 
States had agreed on a financing mechanism that took into account both the economic 
circumstances of the developing countries and the obligation to ensure the systematic funding 
of the AgencyÂs programme. 



62. The Agency played an extremely important role in strengthening nuclear safety and 
promoting the principle of transparency in dealing with any accidents that occurred. She 
urged it to continue to co-operate closely with other international organizations and interested 
parties in that area. 
63. Safeguards were one of the pillars of the Agency and the safeguards system should be 
applied to all States of the Middle East region, including Israel. In that connection, Kuwait 
supported the final document of the 2000 NPT Review Conference and looked forward to 
reaching an agreement, as soon as possible, on the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free 
zone in the Middle East. It also urged the Agency to become more actively involved in 
furthering that goal. The removal of all weapons of mass destruction from the region - not 
only nuclear but also chemical and biological weapons - should be viewed as a concurrent or 
supplementary goal. 
64. Kuwait attached great importance to the AgencyÂs responsibilities vis-Ã -vis Iraq, not 
only because of its action to ensure compliance with Security Council resolutions but also 
because of IraqÂs history of violations of the NPT, undeclared nuclear activities and 
concealment of relevant information from the Agency. 
65. She noted with deep concern that the AgencyÂs activities in Iraq pursuant to Security 
Council resolutions had been suspended since its team left Iraq on 16 December 1998. As the 
Agency was thus unaware of any dangerous activities that Iraq might have conducted in the 
meantime, the return of the team was urgently necessary. Moreover, Iraq continued to ignore 
Security Council resolution 1284 (1999), which reaffirmed the AgencyÂs role in ensuring 
IraqÂs compliance with paragraphs 12 and 13 of resolution 687 (1991) and other related 
resolutions. According to the Director GeneralÂs report contained in document GC(44)/11 
and his statement to the NPT Review Conference on 24 April 2000, the Agency had been 
unable to provide any measure of assurance with regard to IraqÂs compliance with the 
relevant resolutions since December 1998. It should further be noted that the Agency had not 
received from Iraq the semi-annual declarations required by paragraph 22 and Annex 2 of the 
AgencyÂs ongoing monitoring and verification plan regarding the current use of certain 
facilities and the inventory and location of radioactive materials and isotopes. Lastly, she 
stressed the importance of the statement by the Director General in his report that the 
inspection carried out by the Agency in Iraq in January 2000 under the safeguards agreement 
could not serve as a substitute for the AgencyÂs activities under the relevant Security Council 
resolutions and that the resumption of its verification activities under those resolutions was 
essential for the Agency to fulfil its mandate. 
66. Mr. LIPÃR (Slovakia), having endorsed the statement presented on behalf of the 
European Union and associated countries, said that after difficult negotiations, the 2000 NPT 
Review Conference had adopted consensus views on the implementation of the Treaty and 
future challenges. It had reconfirmed that the safeguards system was fundamental to the 
non-proliferation regime and that the IAEA was the competent authority for ensuring 
compliance with safeguards agreements. His country vigorously supported the AgencyÂs 
programme to strengthen the effectiveness and improve the efficiency of safeguards, and in 
September 1999 had signed a new safeguards agreement and an additional protocol whose 



implementation was under way. All nuclear facilities and material on Slovak territory - 
including six reactors and an interim spent fuel storage facility - were now subject to 
full-scope Agency safeguards, as well as to inspections carried out by the national Nuclear 
Regulatory Authority. 
67. According to his Government's energy strategy, nuclear energy would remain an 
important source in the medium term, though safety would be a precondition for its use. A 
project for gradual reconstruction of the Bohunice nuclear power plant was currently 
assessing the implementation of safety improvements in accordance with IAEA 
recommendations. The second unit of the Mochovce nuclear power plant had been started up 
after an extensive safety upgrading programme and a safety review by experts from several 
European countries. In connection with Slovakia's plans to join the European Union, a group 
of experts had also reviewed the legislative framework, the Nuclear Regulatory Authority and 
the safety of nuclear power plants in Slovakia. 
68. With the commissioning of radioactive waste treatment and storage facilities at 
Bohunice and Mochovce, major steps had been taken towards safe and environmentally sound 
management of low- and medium-level radioactive waste. Provision had also been made for 
the safe storage of spent nuclear fuel in the medium term, pending investigations to find a 
repository that was environmentally responsible and acceptable to the public. 
69. In the area of radiation protection, Slovakia had participated in the development of the 
Action Plan for the Safety of Radiation Sources and the Security of Radioactive Materials, 
believing that accidents worldwide in the management of radiation sources called for further 
attention from the international community. 
70. The AgencyÂs expert services were considered an essential part of international 
co-operation in safety-related activities and a major aid to national regulatory 
decision-making. His delegation fully supported the continuation of such safety services as 
OSART and IRRT missions as an important step toward implementation of IAEA safety 
standards, the value of which, and of peer reviews of compliance with the standards, should 
be recognized at the political level. In that context, more attention needed to be given to 
preparing safety standards and initiating safety review services for other nuclear installations 
such as fuel cycle facilities. 
71. Since the previous session of the General Conference the Agency and the Slovak 
Government had jointly organized four workshops and a training course for experts from the 
region. Slovak organizations with extensive experience in the peaceful use of nuclear energy 
were ready to host fellows and scientific visitors for the exchange of experience. A 
particularly important project for Slovakia was one on radiochemical facilities for producing 
medical radionuclides, which would receive Government support in the amount of 
US $1.45 million. 
72. Citing the statement adopted by participants in the International Youth Nuclear 
Congress held in April 2000 in Bratislava, Slovakia, he said that the present generation had 
the responsibility to ensure that the nuclear option was open to future generations and that the 



transfer of know-how would be effected by appropriate national and international 
programmes. The Agency should develop a comprehensive programme devoted to 
co-operation with the younger generation. 
73. One of the main responsibilities of Member States was to ensure that the Agency had 
the necessary human and financial resources to fulfil its statutory obligations. His 
Government therefore welcomed the consensus which had been reached on the financing of 
technical co-operation and the financing of safeguards, and had decided to make a voluntary 
contribution to the TCF for 2001 in an amount consistent with its base rate of assessment. 
74. Mr. PAULINICH (Peru) said that in December 1999, his country had been 
honoured by a visit from the Director General which had reinforced Peru's relationship with 
the Agency and offered a first-hand look at Peru's efforts in the peaceful uses of nuclear 
energy. The Director General had committed the Agency to implementing projects in the 
border areas between Peru and Ecuador to foster co-operation between the two countries, 
including one aimed at expanding and improving diagnosis and treatment in nuclear 
medicine. 
75. Having signed a safeguards agreement in connection with the Tlatelolco Treaty and the 
NPT, his country was committed to transparency under the Agency's safeguards system and 
had established the legal basis for helping to promote a climate of international security. On 
22 March 2000, Peru had signed an additional protocol which, when it entered into force, 
would ensure that both nuclear activities and the handling of nuclear material in Peru took 
place within a framework of efficiency and security. In the interests of strengthening the 
safeguards system, his Government was prepared to hold a regional seminar for the promotion 
of the additional protocol in Lima in 2001. 
76. Although the final document of the 2000 NPT Review Conference had not fully 
satisfied the expectations of all non-nuclear-weapon States, it nevertheless constituted a step 
forward, given the divergence of StatesÂ views on compliance with their commitments under 
the NPT. As an illustration of its own commitment to disarmament and reducing the risk of 
proliferation, Peru had made a large donation of crude oil to the Korean Peninsula Energy 
Development Organization. It also supported the proposal made by the United Nations 
Secretary-General at the Millennium Summit to convene an international conference on ways 
of eliminating nuclear dangers. In December 1999, Peru had hosted the OPANAL General 
Conference which had launched the "Lima Appeal" to the international community to create a 
public awareness in order to advance towards a complete prohibition of the use and 
manufacture of nuclear weapons and weapons of mass destruction, and it supported the 
proposal by the OPANAL Secretary General to hold an international conference of members 
of nuclear-weapon-free zones on nuclear disarmament. 
77. The IAEA had an enormous responsibility in not only preventing the destructive uses, 
but also promoting the peaceful uses of nuclear energy through the transfer of nuclear 
technology to Member States. To that end, co-operation programmes and projects had to be 
allocated adequate and predictable resources, and he called upon the major donor countries to 
fulfil their obligations to the TCF. 



78. Technical assistance under an Agency Model Project had enabled a Peruvian university 
to continue its efforts to promote new strains of barley and other native crops with a high 
nutritional value, with which about 100 000 new hectares were to be sown in the central 
mountain regions. Under hydrological projects being carried out jointly with Bolivia and 
Chile, the evaluation of stable isotopes throughout the Lake Titicaca basin was being pursued 
in the context of a pollution study. The Ministries of Agriculture of Peru and Chile were 
co-operating closely to prevent any resurgence of the Mediterranean fruit fly in border areas. 
79. The Peruvian Nuclear Energy Institute was continuing with a variety of activities, 
including the licensing and registration of installations, dosimetric calibrations, the 
monitoring of background radiation, safe management of low-level radioactive waste and 
production of radioisotopes for use in nuclear medicine and industrial applications, both 
domestically and abroad. Those technical activities had been feasible only with the Agency's 
support, which in 1999 had been realized through 45 advisory missions and 60 purchase 
orders worth over half a million US dollars. An additional form of support was the provision 
of fellowships for training and other events abroad: in 1999, Peruvian specialists had taken 
advantage of 78 such opportunities. 
80. The domestic procedures required for ratification of ARCAL had begun and two 
international events in the context of ARCAL had been organized with Agency support in 
Lima in 1999. The Peruvian legislature was in the final stages of approval of the Convention 
on Supplementary Compensation for Nuclear Damage, the Protocol to Amend the Vienna 
Convention on Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage and the Joint Convention on the Safety of 
Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management. He welcomed 
the Secretariat's work in developing the Agency's Transport Regulations and providing up-to-
date information on the adoption and implementation of their latest version. 
81. He thanked the Agency's Secretariat and the Government of France for their invaluable 
support in the treatment of the patient irradiated in the accident at Yanango in 1999. The 
important experience gained therefrom would be shared with the international community 
through the publication of a report on the accident. 
82. Mr. AL-JANABI (Iraq) observed that Iraq had been one of the first countries to 
join the Agency and had played an effective role in its activities. Like other Member States, 
it had honoured its agreements with and obligations to the organization. It had a legitimate 
right to avail itself of the benefits offered by the Agency in the area of the peaceful uses of 
atomic energy. After the perfidious aggression against Iraq in 1991, the Agency had been 
given a new mandate in Iraq, as defined in paragraphs 12 and 13 of Security Council 
resolution 687 (1991), under which for many years it had performed inspection, verification 
and monitoring activities. In the course of those activities there had been numerous cases of 
abuse, blackmail, aggressive behaviour and espionage on the part of some members of the 
AgencyÂs inspection teams. Nevertheless, Iraq had co-operated effectively with the Agency 
and complied with all its obligations under the Security Council resolutions. 
83. The AgencyÂs activities in Iraq had been used as a cover to prolong the blockade against 
Iraq, so that its credibility and its character as a specialized international technical agency had 



been affected. It had been diverted from its scientific role and transformed into a political 
organization subject to American influence and hegemony. If it had remained faithful to its 
scientific mission, it could have informed the General Conference and the Security Council 
years ago that it had completed its work in Iraq and that only a few questions remained to be 
clarified which would not change the general understanding and the clear picture it had 
obtained of the former Iraqi nuclear programme. That had been confirmed by the Director 
GeneralÂs numerous reports to the Security Council. For instance, paragraph 31 of the 
Attachment to document GOV/INF/1999/4 stated that the IAEAÂs extensive verification 
activities in Iraq, since May 1991, had yielded a technically coherent picture of IraqÂs former 
nuclear programme and had revealed no indication that Iraq possessed nuclear weapons or 
any amounts of weapon-usable nuclear material, or that Iraq had retained any practical 
capability (facilities or hardware) for the production of such material. That statement 
confirmed the falseness of the American and Zionist claim that Iraq was not complying with 
Security Council resolutions relating to the nuclear area. 
84. The Agency had recently been making statements to the effect that it had been unable to 
carry out its tasks and its mandate after its inspectors had left Iraq at the end of 1998. He 
wished to clarify the facts in that regard by emphasizing a number of points. 
85. First, the inspection, monitoring and verification activities in Iraq had been used by the 
United States and the Zionist entity to obtain security and intelligence information about Iraq 
and its national leadership, as had been admitted by members of inspection teams. That had 
been greatly detrimental to the AgencyÂs credibility, role and mandate. 
86. Secondly, the Agency had withdrawn its inspectors from Iraq before 16 December 1998 
on orders from the Chairman of the Special Commission, without authorization by the 
Security Council or by the Director General of the Agency. The purpose had been to 
facilitate the military attack against Iraq by the United States and the United Kingdom on 
16-17 December 1998, which had damaged the sites subject to monitoring by the Agency, 
completely destroyed all monitoring equipment and seriously upset the AgencyÂs ongoing 
monitoring and verification plan in Iraq. 
87. Thirdly, the AgencyÂs reports showed a confusion between its tasks in Iraq under the 
Security Council resolutions and its functions under its Statute and the safeguards agreements 
concluded with Member States. The Security Council resolutions were political instruments 
which lent themselves to blackmail by the United States in the Security Council and in the 
Agency. The implementation of safeguards agreements was the normal sphere of activity for 
the Agency, on which it should concentrate, and it should carry out its obligations under those 
agreements as provided for in the Statute and the NPT. Iraq had complied and was complying 
with its obligations under its safeguards agreement with the Agency, and it called upon the 
Agency to resume its normal functions and comply with its own obligations under that 
agreement. 
88. Fourthly, while Iraq had complied with all its obligations under Part C of Security 
Council resolution 687 (1991) and under resolution 715 (1991), the IAEA and the Security 
Council had not fulfilled their counter-obligations to Iraq under resolution 687 (1991), which 



provided for the lifting of the economic embargo against Iraq, as a result of the unlawful 
position taken by two permanent members of the Security Council, namely the United States 
and the United Kingdom, which were using their influence to prevent the Security Council 
and the IAEA from acknowledging IraqÂs compliance with its obligations in order to prolong 
the blockade against Iraq. The Agency had also failed to carry out its obligations under 
paragraph 13 of resolution 687 (1991) with regard to the rights and obligations of Iraq under 
the NPT. 
89. The two States he had mentioned were carrying out daily bombing of civilian sites and 
public utilities in Iraq, leading to a large number of human victims, as well as damage to 
goods and property, in gross violation of international legality. The international community 
must condemn those military attacks and demand the lifting of the blockade, which had 
continued for ten years without legal justification - indeed which was a heinous genocidal 
crime against the people of Iraq and had led to the death of more than one and a half million 
old men, women and children. 
90. Fifthly, he hoped that the Agency would declare Iraq free from the prohibited weapons 
and inform the Security Council that it had fulfilled its mandate under paragraphs 12 and 13 
of resolution 687 (1991) and thus completed its work, thereby disproving the groundless 
allegations against Iraq used by the United States and the United Kingdom to prolong the 
blockade. 
91. In summary, he wished to inform the General Conference that the implementation of the 
Security Council resolutions in Iraq had been completed and that there remained only 
political issues which were not related to the AgencyÂs work and its technical role under those 
resolutions and its Statute. Therefore the item on Iraq should be removed from the 
ConferenceÂs agenda. 
92. Iraq had enjoyed the benefits of technical co-operation with the Agency until 1991, 
when such co-operation had been stopped. In 1995 some projects in the areas of agriculture 
and medicine had been partially restored. The Agency had approved 7 projects for Iraq for 
the 1999-2000 biennium, including 3 regional projects for West Asia. Thereafter, Iraq had 
submitted 13 technical co-operation projects for 2001-2002, of which the Agency had 
approved only 3. However, as explained by his delegation in document INFCIRC/583, all 
those projects for 1999-2000 and 2001-2002 were now suspended by a decision of the 
Security CouncilÂs Sanctions Committee (Committee 661) making the implementation of 
those projects conditional upon the return of the AgencyÂs officials to Iraq - even though a 
team of Agency inspectors had been to Iraq in January 2000 to carry out verification of 
nuclear material under the safeguards agreement. Nevertheless, Committee 661 persisted in 
its arbitrary position and prevented Iraq from benefiting from the AgencyÂs technical 
co-operation programmes. 
93. IraqÂs technical projects which the Agency had approved related to the humanitarian, 
environmental, agricultural and medical areas and were designed to help eliminate diseases 
and epidemics which were killing people in Iraq every day. However, Iraq was not being 
allowed to participate even in the regional projects on combating the screwworm and other 



pests which might threaten its neighbouring States. He therefore called upon the Conference 
to condemn the imposition, by the United States and the United Kingdom through 
Committee 661, of additional sanctions not included in the relevant Security Council 
resolutions against Iraq. 
94. During the aggression in 1991, all nuclear installations in Iraq had been destroyed and 
the environment contaminated in a number of areas. Iraq had repeatedly sought the AgencyÂs 
assistance in taking remedial measures at the contaminated sites and in containing the harmful 
effects of the contamination on humans and the environment. IraqÂs own efforts in that 
direction had perforce been limited because of the unfair blockade. Serious steps had been 
taken to meet the dangers of contamination in rehabilitating the radioactive waste treatment 
plant at the Tuwaitha site, destroyed during the 1991 attack. In June 1995, the Agency had 
sent a technical team for that purpose but since then the Agency had taken no action to assist 
in the decontamination or in making a survey of the contaminated sites. 
95. As could be seen from documents GC(42)/INF/19 and GC(43)/INF/20, Iraq had 
requested the Agency and the international community to provide assistance in dealing with 
the damage resulting from the use by American and British forces of more than 300 t of 
depleted uranium shells during their aggression against Iraq in 1991. Those shells had not 
only killed thousands of civilians but would produce lethal radiation effects on future 
generations. It would take years to eliminate the harmful effects on the environment, soil, 
water and agriculture of that contamination as well as that arising from the destruction of the 
nuclear installations. However, the Agency had referred IraqÂs request to Committee 661 
instead of shouldering its moral and technical responsibility by helping to solve that serious 
humanitarian problem without allowing it to be linked to political issues. 
96. The establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones was a step forward towards 
eliminating the danger of nuclear weapons and would help to bring tranquillity to areas of 
tension, such as the Middle East which was threatened by Israeli nuclear weapons. IsraelÂs 
nuclear capabilities had been on the General ConferenceÂs agenda for many years, either as a 
separate item or in connection with the application of the AgencyÂs comprehensive safeguards 
in the Middle East. During that time, Israel had rejected all resolutions on the subject and 
refused to sign the relevant international treaties and to place its nuclear installations under 
Agency safeguards. It had even attacked the credibility of the NPT and of NPT safeguards by 
bombing IraqÂs safeguarded nuclear installations in 1981, subsequently refusing to comply 
with Security Council resolution 487 (1981) which condemned that attack and called upon 
Israel to place its nuclear facilities under IAEA safeguards. 
97. The final document of the 2000 NPT Review Conference noted that Israel was the only 
party in the Middle East which had not acceded to the Treaty and had not accepted 
safeguards, thus holding up important steps towards the goal of making the Middle East a 
zone free from weapons of mass destruction. The United States and the United Kingdom 
allowed that state of affairs to continue instead of urging Israel to comply with the provisions 
which had been imposed on the other countries in the region. The international community 
should therefore face up to its responsibility and free the region of the Middle East from the 



dangers of Israeli nuclear weapons by enjoining Israel to accept comprehensive Agency 
safeguards and eliminate its huge nuclear arsenal. 
98. In conclusion, he hoped that the General Conference would play its part in meeting the 
aspirations of the AgencyÂs Member States and especially those of the developing countries 
which were trying to utilize the benefits of nuclear technology for development and progress, 
and that it would not deprive some States of those benefits by applying the unfair double 
standards imposed on the Agency by the hegemonic States. He looked forward to the Agency 
resuming its normal relations with Iraq under the safeguards agreement and distancing itself 
from the positions and resolutions adopted by the Security Council under the influence of the 
United States and the United Kingdom. 
99. Mr. HASHIM (Malaysia) welcomed the new members to the Agency and 
expressed his countryÂs strong interest in assisting other developing Member States in 
promoting the peaceful uses of nuclear technology in non-power applications. It was in that 
spirit that Malaysia had hosted a regional IAEA seminar which had discussed a number of 
strategies and approaches relevant for consideration by national nuclear institutes when 
pursuing self-reliance and sustainability. 
100. On the funding of technical co-operation, he noted that the increased unobligated 
balance reflected in the Technical Co-operation Report for 1999 should not be taken as an 
indication of a surplus in the TCF; in fact, the target figures for the TCF were mere political 
gestures representing only about a third of the total actual requirements of Member States, 
and the apparent surplus was due to lack of adequate support from the Regular Budget for full 
utilization of the TCF. He commended the Department of Technical Co-operation on the 
programme delivery achieved despite that lack of support, and on the considerable 
improvements that had been made to ensure that project requests met the Model Project 
criteria and were consistent with national development programmes. 
101. Turning to the financing of safeguards, he said the circumstances that had led to the 
application of the shielding system had not changed dramatically in the 30 years since its 
introduction and there was no urgent need to alter it. De-shielding as recently agreed upon 
was effectively a transfer of the obligations of developed unshielded Member States to 
developing Member States, and its acceptance by the latter represented a major concession for 
the sake of equitable distribution of obligations. The proposed timetable for the termination 
of shielding was unnecessarily inflexible, since a countryÂs economic status could well 
change in a short period of time, as demonstrated by the Asian financial crisis; a review 
mechanism to cater for such changes was therefore desirable. Moreover, although per capita 
gross national product could be used for the categorization of Member States for de-shielding 
purposes, other factors also should be considered, including whether the country was a 
nuclear-weapon State, had a significant nuclear power programme or nuclear-fuel processing 
or mining activities or occupied a designated seat on the Board of Governors. The attainment 
of TCF target figures in accordance with the rate of attainment mechanism only partly 
reciprocated the concession made by the developing Member States in agreeing to the 
removal of shielding. It was therefore necessary to keep the financing of safeguards under 



review so as to guarantee that burdens across all domains of the Agency's activities were 
shared equitably. 
102. Malaysia welcomed the final document of the 2000 NPT Review Conference and its 
provisions regarding the strengthened safeguards system and the relationship between 
safeguards agreements and additional protocols. The grace period allowed for States to 
prepare for the implementation of additional protocols by reviewing and updating their 
national legal instruments was certainly helpful. He also welcomed the Conference's 
recommendation that the Agency and Member States should consider specific measures to 
assist States with limited experience in nuclear activities in fulfilling their legal requirements 
with a view to facilitating the conclusion and entry into force of safeguards agreements and 
additional protocols. 
103. His delegation acknowledged the Agency's help in exploring appropriate mechanisms 
for implementing the Bangkok Treaty, in particular its support for the workshop on the 
Treaty's implementation held in Bangkok from 23 to 25 August 2000. The Treaty had been 
instrumental in encouraging States in the region to sign safeguards agreements with the 
Agency. In contrast to other nuclear-weapon-free zone treaties, the Bangkok Treaty 
contained provisions on nuclear safety and radiation protection, including safe disposal of 
nuclear and radioactive waste, that introduced an added difficulty in devising a suitable 
verification system. The Agency might be able to help resolve that difficulty. 
104. The 27th session of the Islamic Conference of Foreign Ministers, convened in Kuala 
Lumpur from 27 to 30 June 2000, had discussed a number of issues of relevance to the 
Agency, including nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation, the right to develop peaceful 
nuclear programmes to promote economic and social development, the need for Israel to join 
the NPT, the desirability of establishing a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Asia and the 
dumping of nuclear and toxic waste. 
105. In conclusion, he said he shared the Director General's concern about the cash-flow 
problems faced by the Agency. Malaysia for its part would continue to fulfil its financial 
commitments, including the payment of assessed programme costs and contributions to the 
TCF. 
106. Mr. DUBOIS (Canada) noted that his country had recently deposited its 
instruments of acceptance of the amendment of Articles VI and XIV of the Agency's Statute 
and invited other Member States to take the steps required for implementation of the 
amendments in a timely fashion. 
107. The twenty-first century could be faced with prudent optimism owing to the success of 
the 2000 NPT Review Conference and other progress towards arms control and disarmament 
worldwide. His country welcomed the recent signature of a bilateral agreement between the 
United States of America and the Russian Federation on the management and disposition of 
plutonium no longer required for military purposes. The Agency could play a key role in 
verification of the agreement and in ensuring that such material was never again used for 
military purposes. 



108. Although such progress was encouraging, four Member States of the Agency - India, 
Pakistan, Israel and Cuba - had still not ratified the NPT. He called on those States to adhere 
unconditionally to the Treaty as non-nuclear-weapon States. The situation in southern Asia 
following the nuclear tests of 1998 and the lack of progress by India and Pakistan towards 
compliance with Security Council resolution 1172 (1998) remained sources of concern. Early 
ratification by those countries of the CTBT, as promised, would be a significant and 
constructive step forward. The fact that the Agency could still not provide any assurances 
whatsoever that Iraq was fulfilling its obligations under Security Council 
resolutions 687 (1991) and 1284 (1999) was also a source of concern. Canada welcomed the 
progress made on the Korean peninsula and had officially recognized the Democratic People's 
Republic of Korea in July 2000. It called on the DPRK to furnish the Agency with all the 
information required to verify its initial declaration under its safeguards agreement, which 
remained binding and in force. 
109. With the entry into force on 31 May 2000 of new legislation on nuclear safety and 
regulatory activities in Canada, the regulatory agency had been restructured and the relevant 
legal regime reinforced in a clear demonstration of Canada's commitment to achieving the 
highest levels of safety and security. As part of its international co-operation in the peaceful 
uses of nuclear energy, his Government had recently decided to provide 5 million Canadian 
dollars for the development of an international training and demonstration facility for nuclear 
fuel waste management and disposal based at an underground research laboratory in 
Manitoba. 
110. His country welcomed the decision of Ukraine to shut down the Chernobyl nuclear 
power plant on 15 December 2000 and had committed US $33 million to that vitally 
important project, hoping also that further progress would be made with the Shelter 
Implementation Plan. 
111. Nuclear power currently provided about 15% of his country's electrical requirements. 
Without it, greenhouse gas emissions from the electrical sector would be 50% greater. Work 
to facilitate the restart of laid-up nuclear power plants in Ontario was continuing; such 
measures would help Canada to fulfil its commitments under the Kyoto Protocol. 
112. Canada strongly supported the Agency's safeguards system, and he was pleased to 
announce that its additional protocol had entered into force on 8 September 2000. He called 
on other Member States which had not yet done so to sign and implement a safeguards 
agreement and an additional protocol as quickly as possible. 
113. Canada endorsed the efforts to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of safeguards 
and accordingly looked forward to the implementation of integrated safeguards, which it 
hoped would bring a more qualitative and flexible approach without exceeding the prevailing 
budgetary constraints. With regard to the financing of safeguards, he welcomed the 
agreement which had recently been reached as it would mean that all Member States would 
pay their full share of the cost of that activity. 



114. The physical protection of nuclear material and facilities was an integral part of an 
effective international non-proliferation regime, and his country believed that the Convention 
on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material must be strengthened to include, among other 
things, the physical protection of nuclear materials in domestic use, storage and transport. 
115. Canada had made a voluntary contribution of over 2 million Canadian dollars to the 
TCF for 2000. Good results continued to be achieved by the technical co-operation 
programme in a difficult environment. Its total resources had reached a record high in the 
past year and the rate of implementation of 75% was excellent. Canada fully supported the 
efforts being made to improve the administration of the programme. As a major contributor 
to the TCF, however, it retained some reservations about the programme's financing and was 
disappointed in particular that contributions for 2000 had not been commensurate with 
expectations. Canada welcomed the decision to freeze the Fund's target at its current level for 
the 2001-2002 biennium as part of the new approach that would, it was to be hoped, resolve 
the major problem of non-payment of contributions by many Member States. 
116. The NPT Review Conference had once again acknowledged the need to provide the 
Agency with sufficient resources to enable it to carry out its diverse responsibilities, but it 
was up to the Agency to ensure that its resources were used in the most effective manner 
possible. Canada continued to advocate nominal budgetary growth for all international 
organizations, including the Agency. It welcomed the considerable progress made in 
reducing costs and improving efficiency in various areas but believed further cost savings 
were possible without adversely affecting the Agency's activities. 
117. Congratulating the Agency on the new results-based approach to drawing up the 
programme and budget, he said the process must be made as transparent and as responsive to 
Member StatesÂ needs as possible and must minimize duplication of activities with other 
international organizations. Canada fully supported the Director General's efforts to improve 
the Agency's management and operation and believed that greater flexibility in the allocation 
of resources among major programmes as priorities evolved would be beneficial for the 
Agency as a whole. 
118. In conclusion, Canada was optimistic about the Agency's activities in the new century 
and was ready to co-operate with it in deriving the maximum benefits from the peaceful use 
of nuclear technology and nuclear energy.

GENERAL DEBATE AND ANNUAL REPORT FOR 1999 (continued) 

(GC(45)/4) 

 

1. Ms. PELLICER SILVA (Mexico) said that the sixth NPT Review Conference had 
been remarkable in that the nuclear-weapon States had committed themselves for the first 
time to the total elimination of their nuclear arsenals. That commitment represented a major 
step forward in the efforts which Mexico and other countries had long been making to 
promote disarmament and international peace and security, and it opened up prospects for 
strict compliance with the NPT and with other instruments such as the CTBT. The advances 
made at the Conference could have a significant impact on the AgencyÂs future role in the 
verification field. Additional financial resources might be required for new activities, and 
countries in the strongest financial positions should make the necessary effort. 
2. A strengthened safeguards system, integrating traditional safeguards measures and the 
measures foreseen under the Model Additional Protocol, was likewise essential if the Agency 
was to meet the verification responsibilities entrusted to it by the international community. 
However, that goal could not be achieved until a sufficient number of countries signed 
additional protocols. Mexico was hoping to be in a position to sign its own additional 
protocol as soon as possible. 
3. Despite the many commendable efforts that had been made, the problem of the 
financing of technical co-operation had not been finally resolved. Moreover, it was difficult 
to ignore the fact that not all countries that joined the Agency accepted all the provisions of 
its Statute, such as that in Article III.A.2 concerning the Agency's responsibility to make 
provision for materials, services, equipment and facilities to meet the needs of research on, 
and development and practical application of, atomic energy for peaceful purposes. Yet 
successive NPT Review Conferences had recognized the importance of the AgencyÂs efforts 
in the field of technology transfer, and Article IV of the NPT specifically enjoined signatories 
to promote that activity. 
4. She commended the Agency's work on the eradication of the screwworm in the 
Caribbean region using sterile insects produced in a plant in Chiapas, Mexico. The Mexican 
National Institute for Nuclear Research was benefiting from Agency support in its work on 
the production of radiopharmaceuticals for the treatment of cancer and the setting up of a 
radiosterilized tissue bank for treatment of burns. It was also studying the use of nuclear 
techniques to preserve cultural heritage. The National Commission for Nuclear Safety and 
Safeguards, in an attempt to recoup costs, had recently instituted a charge for licences for 
users of radioactive material, which should improve its operating capacity. As part of the 
technical co-operation project on upgrading of the safety of radioactive waste management, 
moves were afoot to develop a national policy on radioactive waste. With the AgencyÂs 
assistance, the National Institute for Nuclear Research was currently upgrading MexicoÂs 
radioactive waste storage centre. 
5. Mexico had been the first country in the region to ratify the ARCAL agreement and it 
urged other countries involved in the ARCAL programme to do likewise. It also welcomed 
the Agency's support for the programme and hoped it would increase. 



6. The Laguna Verde nuclear power plant had been operating without incident, and the 
National Commission for Nuclear Safety and Safeguards had approved a 5% power increase 
for both units. The Agency was providing support for the plantÂs ongoing safety culture 
programme, and a number of seminars were to be held there over the coming months. It 
would also receive an IRRT visit. In order to meet the concerns of some sectors of the public 
over the plant's safety, a technical review was to be carried out by a private entity with 
international experience in the field. 
7. Over the preceding two years, co-operation among Member States had helped resolve 
two long-standing issues: the amendment of Article VI and the elimination of the shielding 
system in the financing of safeguards. It was to be hoped that similar efforts would be made 
to strengthen the three pillars of the Agency. In particular, Mexico hoped to see the 
establishment of a universal nuclear safety culture based on legally binding instruments and 
appropriate regulations and procedures, a fully functioning integrated safeguards system, and 
a TCF with adequate resources to respond fully to project requests from Member States. 
8. Mr. EGLAJS (Latvia) commended the efforts to speed up implementation of 
important resolutions of the preceding General Conference, such as those on combating of 
illicit trafficking and strengthening of nuclear, radiation and waste safety. 
9. Latvia had been paving the way for significant changes in its radiation safety 
infrastructure over the current year. A framework law on radiation and nuclear safety should 
come into force early in 2001. The AgencyÂs Legal Division had provided swift and efficient 
assistance when the Latvian Parliament had raised questions concerning the draft of that law. 
With the promised support from Sweden, Denmark and other neighbouring countries, a new 
regulatory body should be established and be in a position to work successfully from the 
outset. 
10. His country had submitted a ratification document for the Joint Convention on the 
Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management 
earlier in the year and hoped to sign its additional protocol soon. It had made the 
amendments to domestic legislation required for the ratification of the Convention on the 
Physical Protection of Nuclear Material and the Protocol to Amend the Vienna Convention on 
Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage. 
11. Co-operation with Nordic countries continued to be a success. Joint investigations had 
been carried out with Sweden and Norway on combating of illicit trafficking. The results had 
been published in English and translated into several other languages. 
12. With regard to the decommissioning of its research reactor, it was not always easy for a 
country like Latvia to apply internationally agreed approaches to such activities. One 
important task which would have to be carried out over the coming few years was the 
handling of spent, highly enriched nuclear fuel. In the past, such material had been returned 
to the supplier, but that approach was now open to question. Latvia therefore strongly 
supported the initiatives of the Agency and the United States of America to establish a take-
back programme and hoped that the Russian Government would accept that approach. That 



would enable Latvia and several other countries to fulfil their responsibilities safely, and 
would minimize the risk of loss of control over such material. 
13. Turning to technical co-operation issues, he noted that Latvia had pledged its full share 
to the TCF for 2000. A joint financing approach had been used successfully for the 
subregional project on establishment of a secondary standard dosimetry laboratory. A similar 
approach was being considered for the decommissioning project. Extra funds from 
beneficiary countries would make project implementation more efficient. 
14. Mr. de QUEIROZ DUARTE (Brazil) commended the Agency's efforts to achieve 
a global safety regime which would facilitate the implementation by Member States of the 
latest standards in the safe use of nuclear energy. He also thanked the Agency for its prompt 
response to the request for a technical evaluation mission on nuclear waste at the Angra I 
nuclear power plant. Its recommendations had been most useful to Brazil in its efforts to 
improve nuclear waste management and disposal. 
15. With a coastline of over 7000 km, his country was greatly concerned at the increasing 
frequency of maritime transport of radioactive material and nuclear waste. Owing to the 
potential risks to the health of coastal populations and the marine environment, Brazil and 
other countries of the Southern Cone had been advocating the strengthening of the relevant 
international regime. 
16. Brazil strongly supported ARCAL which, since its inception, had promoted nuclear 
applications in such areas as human health, the environment, agriculture and industry, all of 
which had a strong social impact. The Agency should continue to give due priority in its 
technical co-operation programme to nuclear power generation, radiation and isotope 
technologies, and the management and disposal of radioactive waste. It was also imperative 
that Member StatesÂ own interests continue to be taken into account in the approval of 
technical co-operation projects. 
17. The agreements reached by the Board of Governors on the financing of technical 
co-operation and safeguards reflected the growing perception by Member States of a common 
responsibility for the achievement of shared objectives in technology transfer and verification. 
In view of the new activities that the Agency was likely to be asked to undertake, the quest for 
efficiency and cost-effectiveness in safeguards implementation was of particular importance. 
Brazil welcomed the steps which were being taken to integrate both traditional and new 
safeguards measures. Co-operation between ABACC and the Agency should contribute to 
the streamlining of the safeguards system. Brazil, Argentina and ABACC had initiated 
informal contacts with the Secretariat regarding an additional protocol to the Quadripartite 
Agreement. 
18. At the sixth NPT Review Conference, the five nuclear-weapon States had for the first 
time unequivocally undertaken to eliminate totally their nuclear arsenals. The establishment 
of a detailed programme of action would facilitate future evaluation of the progress achieved. 
If momentum was maintained, those groundbreaking developments could help break the 



impasse in the Conference on Disarmament and encourage countries to proceed with the 
ratifications needed for the entry into force of the CTBT. 
19. The year 2000 had brought with it major developments in the peaceful use of nuclear 
energy in Brazil, notably the commissioning of the Angra II nuclear power plant which was 
already generating electricity at 80% of its total capacity and would add 1300 MW(e) to the 
national power grid when it became fully operational. Uranium extraction activities had 
begun at a new mine which was expected to produce enough uranium to meet a large part of 
domestic needs, and a new plant for reconversion of uranium hexafluoride and fabrication of 
uranium dioxide pellets had been opened. Nuclear research centres had been set up in the 
central western and north-eastern regions of the country. Steady investment in recent years 
had brought about remarkable improvements in the quality and quantity of 
radiopharmaceutical production, where domestic capacity had doubled compared with 1995. 
20. Mr. WÃHLK (Denmark) said that one important and welcome outcome of the 
NPT Review Conference had been the confirmation by the States party to the Treaty, and not 
least by the nuclear-weapon States, of their commitment to nuclear disarmament. The 
Conference also reconfirmed the importance of Agency safeguards for the international 
non-proliferation regime, and had endorsed the measures contained in the Model Additional 
Protocol. Those measures once implemented would substantially strengthen the AgencyÂs 
safeguards system and put the Agency in a better position to detect clandestine nuclear 
activities in non-nuclear-weapon States. Denmark was a party to the additional protocol 
concluded in September 1998 between the Agency, EURATOM and the 13 non-nuclear-
weapon States of the European Union, and was doing its best to implement its new 
obligations. It remained concerned, however, that 50 non-nuclear-weapon States party to the 
NPT had not yet even signed basic safeguards agreements and urged all States to comply with 
their obligations under the Treaty. 
21. Supplier countries had long recognized their responsibility to prevent the proliferation 
of nuclear weapons. Effective export control was a precondition for co-operation in the 
peaceful use of nuclear energy under the NPT. Denmark fully endorsed the recommendation 
of the NPT Review Conference that transparency be maintained in supplier arrangements. 
The Nuclear Suppliers Group played an important role in that regard. 
22. Many nuclear power plants still operated at unacceptably low levels of safety, and 
management of nuclear waste was still unsatisfactory. As there was no evidence that spent 
fuel and high-level radioactive waste could be managed safely in the long term, Denmark 
belonged to the growing group of countries that could not support nuclear power as an option. 
Although the assistance the Agency provided in safety matters to the countries of Central and 
Eastern Europe was of paramount importance, the only defensible solution for certain reactors 
operating in those countries was to shut them down as soon as possible. 
23. Denmark supported the creation of a comprehensive and legally binding safety regime 
of which the Convention on Nuclear Safety, the Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel 
Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management and the Convention on the 
Physical Protection of Nuclear Material would be the main pillars. It also supported the 



ongoing efforts to revise the latter instrument. The adoption of the Protocol to Amend the 
Vienna Convention on Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage and the Convention on 
Supplementary Compensation for Nuclear Damage were appropriate steps towards 
strengthening the nuclear liability regime. 
24. Since no sustainable solutions had been found to the problems of safety and waste 
storage, Denmark found it disturbing that so much effort was being expended worldwide to 
extend the use of nuclear power. Agency technical assistance should not be used for the 
general promotion of nuclear power. Instead, programmes should be demand-driven and 
should promote the highest possible safety standards in those countries that had chosen the 
nuclear option to meet their development needs. It was on that understanding that Denmark 
had accepted the target of US $73 million for the TCF for 2001 and had pledged its full share. 
25. With regard to the budgetary situation, high-priority activities such as safeguards and 
verification should continue to be financed by the Agency's core budget. With regard to the 
sharing of safeguards financing, Denmark supported a solution whereby Member States 
would contribute according to the normal United Nations scale of assessment. 
26. Ms. HERNES (Norway) expressed the hope that the consensus reached at the 
NPT Review Conference on nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation would be followed up 
by practical action by all parties to the Treaty. The initiative taken by all nuclear-weapon 
States to place fissile material no longer required for military purposes under Agency or other 
international verification arrangements should contribute significantly to the overall efforts to 
reduce the risk of proliferation of weapons-usable fissile material. The positive results of the 
NPT Review Conference had also extended to agreement on several recommendations that 
would strengthen export controls and promote transparency thereof. 
27. The additional protocol to Norway's safeguards agreement had entered into force in 
May 2000 and the work of implementing the necessary reporting and verification procedures 
was well under way. It was disappointing that around 50 countries party to the NPT had still 
not concluded comprehensive safeguards agreements with the Agency, and that only 
52 countries had signed additional protocols of which only 15 were in force. She commended 
the Agency for taking steps to encourage more States to conclude additional protocols. 
28. The international instruments and standards in whose management and implementation 
the Agency played a leading role had only a limited effect without the active involvement of 
Member States. In that connection, she urged Member States to sign and ratify the Joint 
Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste 
Management so that it could enter into force as soon as possible. 
29. Nuclear or radiological emergencies could easily turn into international problems 
requiring international solutions. Norway strongly supported the Agency's work on 
developing and implementing practical procedures in connection with the Early Notification 
and Assistance Conventions, but felt that the response capabilities of Member States would be 
improved and the system made more cost-effective if the Agency devoted even greater efforts 



to co-ordinating international response. Sufficient financial and human resources should 
therefore be allocated to carrying out those tasks. 
30. Her country also supported the AgencyÂs initiatives in respect of the safety of radiation 
sources, security of radioactive material and the prevention of illicit trafficking and, in that 
context, she commended those countries which were engaged in bilateral projects aimed at 
improving the level of security and safety in countries that had requested such assistance. 
31. Although the Medium Term Strategy should maintain a proper balance between the 
different pillars of the Agency's activities, safety and security issues and the fulfilment of its 
legal obligations had to be the Agency's primary objectives in the twenty-first century. 
32. Norway was participating in a number of nuclear safety-related projects in north-
western Russia involving the development of governmental structures, the purchase of 
technical equipment, the elaboration of normative documents and the implementation of 
accountancy systems and physical protection measures; and it was co-operating closely with 
the relevant Russian authorities. 
33. The Russian Federation was currently faced with major problems in connection with the 
decommissioning and dismantling of a large number of nuclear-powered vessels, and the safe 
conditioning and storage of radioactive waste and spent fuel. A completely new 
infrastructure was needed, requiring enormous investments. 
34. A strategy for nuclear clean-up in Russia, with a list of priority projects, had been 
established in close co-operation with the Russian authorities within the CEG under the 
auspices of the Agency. Norway, the United States of America and a number of European 
countries were currently working to establish a multilateral legal framework for provision of 
assistance to nuclear safety projects in the Russian Federation under an agreement that 
covered nuclear liability, accountability, accessibility and exemption from taxes and customs 
duties on international aid. Those efforts would greatly facilitate multilateral involvement in 
nuclear clean-up activities in the region and joint funding of larger projects. It was essential 
that environmental impact assessments were carried out for multilateral and bilateral nuclear 
safety projects, in order to ensure that optimal solutions were adopted with minimum risk of 
environmental contamination. 
35. Norway and the Russian Federation were heading the work on radioactive 
contamination under the Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme. Future work under 
that Programme would focus on environmental surveillance and the impact of radioactive 
contamination. In 1998, the Contracting Parties to the OSPAR Convention for the Protection 
of the Marine Environment of the North East Atlantic had agreed on a strategy which 
envisaged significant reductions in discharges of radionuclides into the ocean. 
36. Her country hoped that the introduction of the rate of attainment mechanism would help 
increase payments to the TCF. However, the main goal should be to encourage members to 
pay their assessed contributions in full and on time. The main focus of technical co-operation 
activities should be on nuclear applications in agriculture, dam and water resource 



management, and human health and medicine; nuclear power projects should concentrate on 
safety and the problems of waste and spent fuel. 
37. Mr. ARAMRATTANA (Thailand) said that, at the NPT Review Conference 
in 2000, all States party to the NPT had reaffirmed the vital role the Agency played in 
safeguards, safety and technology transfer. Thailand supported a strengthened safeguards 
system based on additional protocols, but the latter would only be effective in enhancing 
nuclear non-proliferation when they were equitably and universally applied. Measures should 
therefore be taken to assist States with the conclusion and implementation of additional 
protocols. 
38. The decision to end the shielding system was a major concession by the shielded 
countries for the sake of equity in the obligations and commitments of all Member States. 
The indicators for establishing the categories of shielded members should not be based solely 
on per capita GNP: other legitimate indicators such as significant nuclear activities, 
possession of nuclear weapons, and the arrangements for designated seats on the Board under 
the amended Article VI of the Statute should also be taken into consideration. Moreover, the 
freezing of categories during the phasing out of the shielding system did not allow for 
re-categorization of shielded members if their per capita GNP changed owing to adverse 
economic conditions. A mechanism for reviewing the implementation of the new 
arrangement should accordingly be established to ensure fair treatment, and the major 
concession made by shielded members should be truly reciprocated in all areas of the 
AgencyÂs activities. 
39. Contributions to the TCF, though voluntary in nature, should be treated as a political 
commitment, since the Fund needed to be predictable, adequate and assured. Thailand had 
done its best to pledge and pay its full share to the TCF every year, despite economic 
difficulties, and he urged other Member States to do the same in order to ensure that the 
Agency had the necessary financial and human resources to meet its responsibilities in the 
technical co-operation field. The proposed rate of attainment mechanism was meant to 
stimulate the flow of resources to the Fund. However, there was an enormous difference 
between a concession with regard to obligatory contributions and a stimulating mechanism 
for voluntary contributions. 
40. As a country that had recently experienced a radiological accident, Thailand applauded 
the Agency's efforts in the nuclear safety field, in particular the preparation of the Code of 
Conduct on the Safety and Security of Radioactive Sources and the implementation of the 
related Action Plan. Increased awareness of nuclear, radiological and waste safety issues 
through public information, training and safety-related activities was required to prevent 
accidents from occurring. Despite its tragic aspect, Thailand regarded the accident as a lesson 
to be learned from and shared with other Member States. A report was currently being 
drafted and would be published as part of a series of reports on radiological accidents 
worldwide. He thanked the Government of Japan and the Agency for their prompt response 
and the French authorities for their offer of help. 



41. With regard to illicit trafficking, he pointed out that the NPT regime was the one most 
relevant to nuclear material, while the safety regime applied most directly to other radiation 
sources. Each regime had its own preventive measures with different political implications. 
Thus, the Agency should strengthen separately the preventive measures under the NPT 
regime and the safety regime with a view to minimizing the possibility of illicit trafficking of 
nuclear material and other radiation sources. 
42. As the depositary State of the Bangkok Treaty, Thailand appreciated the close 
co-operation between the Agency and the States party to the Southeast Asia Nuclear-Weapon-
Free Zone. Consultations had taken place to identify key issues in the Treaty's 
implementation and to seek possible forms of co-operation between ASEAN and the Agency, 
and a workshop on implementation of the Treaty had been held from 23 to 25 August 2000 in 
Bangkok. He hoped that co-operation would continue and expand. 
43. Mr. SAHINBAS (Turkey) said that the preceding year had shown that the risks of 
non-compliance with nuclear safety rules were not confined within geographical borders. The 
AgencyÂs vigilance regarding safety issues was highly commendable and was illustrated by 
the successful conclusion of the first review meeting of the Contracting Parties to the 
Convention on Nuclear Safety, the assistance it had provided to four countries including 
Turkey in emergency situations, its efforts to improve reactor safety in the countries of 
Central and Eastern Europe, and the establishment of TranSAS. 
44. In the radiation safety field, Turkey welcomed the establishment of the peer review 
teams, which should have an important impact on improvement of legal and regulatory 
frameworks and staff training; and the completion of the safety guide on radiation protection 
in medical exposure. The Action Plan for the Safety of Radiation Sources and the Security of 
Radioactive Materials should also alleviate the concerns of many Member States. 
45. General Conference resolutions GC(42)/RES/13 and GC(43)/RES/11 on safe transport 
of radioactive material constituted important steps forward and had created the basis for the 
establishment of TranSAS; moreover, by creating a mechanism for the exchange of 
information upon request, they had helped build confidence between shipping States and 
potentially affected States. The Turkish authorities had decided to apply for a TranSAS 
evaluation of TurkeyÂs national regulations on the safe transport of radioactive material. 
46. In view of its proximity to regions where there was generally considered to be a high 
risk of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, Turkey attached importance to the 
speedy entry into force of the strengthened safeguards system. It had recently signed an 
additional protocol to its safeguards agreement and was taking steps to ensure its early 
ratification. 
47. The main responsibility for efficient international co-operation in the prevention of 
proliferation lay with supplier countries, but countries on the routes of nuclear-related 
transfers should also shoulder their responsibilities and co-operate with suppliers to prevent 
unauthorized access to such goods and technologies. Thus, after establishing the necessary 



export control regulations at the domestic level, Turkey had joined the Zangger Committee 
and the Nuclear Suppliers Group. 
48. While the new climate which was beginning to prevail on the Korean peninsula gave 
rise to hope, Turkey joined in the international community's invitation to the Democratic 
People's Republic of Korea to comply with its safeguards agreement and co-operate closely 
with the Agency. Similarly, Iraq had to abide by Security Council resolution 1284 and extend 
its collaboration to the newly established UNMOVIC and to the Agency. 
49. His country welcomed the adoption by consensus of the final document of the 2000 
NPT Review Conference and noted with satisfaction that, once again, 187 countries had 
confirmed the validity and importance of the nuclear non-proliferation regime established by 
the Treaty. 
50. Curbing illicit trafficking in nuclear material was another way of preventing 
proliferation. He invited States to implement the AgencyÂs recommendations on the physical 
protection of nuclear material and to undertake a review of the Convention on the Physical 
Protection of Nuclear Material with the aim of broadening its scope. The registration by 
exporter and importer countries of radiation sources used in industry and medicine could help 
ensure proper control of such sources. 
51. For countries in the developing world that were seeking increased electricity production 
in the context of sustainable development, the energy that could be derived from renewable 
sources was insufficient for use in long-term, large-scale applications. Despite its higher 
capital cost, nuclear power was therefore still one of the options most frequently envisaged. 
Despite the Turkish GovernmentÂs decision to postpone its plans for the Akkuyu nuclear 
power plant on account of economic reforms, the nuclear option remained on the countryÂs 
agenda. Turkey hoped that the AgencyÂs studies on small- and medium-sized reactors would 
assist developing countries in more accurately targeting their energy strategies. 
52. The Agency should play a role in helping national authorities educate the public about 
nuclear energy. Especially in countries where the construction of nuclear power plants was 
being contemplated for the first time, anti-nuclear lobbies were presenting the waste problem 
as a complex one with no solution. 
53. Many nuclear research centres had developed expertise in a whole spectrum of nuclear 
fields and, by virtue of their multidisciplinary nature, had contributed to technology 
development and benefited industry. The Agency should assist such centres by collecting and 
furnishing information on the global and regional benefits of nuclear technology. 
54. Under the Montreal Protocol, the use of chemicals for food preservation was to be 
phased out by the year 2005 and food irradiation would accordingly be used increasingly as a 
means of conservation. The Agency should engage in further research on the development of 
food irradiation techniques and the improvement of food safety. 



55. Nuclear techniques in medicine were widely used in Turkey and, owing to their 
increasing importance for human health, the quality of the relevant standards needed to be 
improved. The AgencyÂs guidance in that area would facilitate quality assurance. 
56. Co-ordinated research programmes had proved to be one of the most effective ways of 
disseminating and exchanging information on recent developments in nuclear-related fields, 
and the resources for increasing the number of such programmes should be secured. 
57. Through the AgencyÂs technical co-operation activities, countries received assistance, 
co-operated with the Agency and collaborated among themselves in a wide spectrum of fields 
ranging from human health to nuclear safety. Co-ordination between the technical 
departments and the Department of Technical Co-operation, however, still needed to be 
improved. In addition, clear criteria needed to be defined for upgrading of footnote-a/ 
projects. 
58. The financial requirements for such a wide spectrum of activities were clearly quite 
large, yet the technical co-operation needs of developing countries were being met through 
unsatisfactory voluntary contributions. It was therefore essential that Member States abide by 
their pledges. Turkey was pledging its full share to the TCF for 2001. 
59. Mr. KURDI (Saudi Arabia) commended the Director General on his continuing 
efforts to reform and modernize the Agency, applying the Âone-house approachÂ, 
rationalizing use of resources, and judiciously combining regular programme and technical 
co-operation activities. 
60. The Agency had developed an effective results-based approach to technical co-
operation with and among its Member States, promoting technology transfer and enhancing 
StatesÂ research capabilities. Two regional training courses had been organized in Saudi 
Arabia in the preceding year on non-destructive testing and in-service inspection for industry, 
and on the production and control of radiopharmaceuticals. 
61. While stressing the importance of the safeguards system in maintaining international 
security, he expressed concern at the failure of the Agency to provide a detailed picture of the 
costs and proposed means of financing of the anticipated increase in inspection activities as a 
result of various requests and initiatives. That trend could be expected to lead to a reduction 
in funding for development-related programme activities in budgets based on the principle of 
zero real growth. 
62. During its previous session, the General Conference had stressed the importance of 
applying comprehensive safeguards to all nuclear activities in the States of the Middle East, 
and the desirability of establishing an NWFZ in the region, an aspiration echoed by the 
United Nations General Assembly. The final document of the 2000 NPT Review Conference 
had reaffirmed the importance of IsraelÂs accession to the NPT and the placement of all its 
nuclear facilities under Agency safeguards. Saudi Arabia had proposed that Israel should, as 
a first step, announce its willingness to apply Agency safeguards without joining the NPT for 
the time being. The Director General could rely on his countryÂs full support in his efforts to 



apply safeguards to all nuclear activities in the Middle East as a prerequisite for the 
establishment of an NWFZ. 
63. The Agency had acquired considerable knowledge and expertise on nuclear power 
plants and reactors, fuel cycle facilities and radioactive waste, and had developed contacts 
with non-traditional partners and the general public to ensure that the use of nuclear power 
was consistent with the aims of sustainable development. Nuclear power currently produced 
16% of the worldÂs electricity and would undoubtedly play an important role in meeting 
future demand, which was expected to increase threefold over the next 50 years. However, in 
addition to being faced with technical, economic and political obstacles, it was also unpopular 
among the general public, especially since the Chernobyl and Tokaimura accidents. 
64. The Agency had made laudable efforts to assist Member States in devising sound and 
sustainable energy strategies. However, the AgencyÂs statements regarding the 
non-sustainability of fossil and other fuels seemed to reflect a bias in favour of nuclear power, 
in contradiction to the evidence of the risks to human health and the environment from the 
operation of nuclear facilities, transport of nuclear material, nuclear accidents and disposal of 
radioactive waste. The relevant international fora had not yet completed their comparative 
assessment of the future prospects of nuclear power from the standpoint of sustainable 
development, costs, competitiveness and public confidence. The Scientific Forum on the role 
of nuclear power in sustainable development held during the preceding session of the General 
Conference had failed to agree either on the concept of sustainability or on the role of nuclear 
power in meeting the growing demand for electricity in the face of stiff competition from 
natural gas- and coal-fired power plants. Efforts to enhance the competitiveness of nuclear 
power should focus on its intrinsic advantages and high safety standards rather than on the 
imposition of environmental taxes or restrictions on its competitors. In that connection, he 
commended the AgencyÂs efforts to promote effective safety standards and a global nuclear 
safety culture. 
65. Saudi Arabia paid its contributions to the Regular Budget at the beginning of every 
year. The Board of Governors had noted the impact of adverse economic circumstances on 
the ability of low-income States and countries in transition to finance programme activities, 
had discussed the matter from the standpoint of the financing of safeguards and of technical 
co-operation, and had recommended a temporary reduction in TCF resources with a gradual 
restoral to their current level, and the phasing out of the shielding mechanism for low-income 
countries for financing of safeguards. While he understood the reasons for those proposals, 
he feared that they would lead to a decline in funds for technical co-operation and an increase 
in those for safeguards, to the detriment of developing Member States. Saudi Arabia 
therefore reiterated its request for financing of technical co-operation through the Regular 
Budget. 
66. Mr. ALEXANDRIS (Greece) said that although individual countries bore the 
ultimate responsibility for the safe operation of their nuclear facilities, the role of setting 
standards and ensuring their worldwide application belonged to the Agency. Greece 
especially appreciated the Agency's long-standing efforts to improve reactor safety in the 
countries of Central and Eastern Europe. Projects on the safety of ageing nuclear power 



plants should be given special emphasis in the Agency's programme and budget for 2001. 
Moreover, decommissioning of nuclear facilities was bound to become a challenge in the 
future going far beyond the borders of the countries directly involved. Greece would also 
welcome every effort made to increase the safety of radiation sources, including the adoption 
of legally binding measures to enable the Agency to discharge its functions fully under 
Article III.A.6 of the Statute. 
67. On 17 July 2000, Greece had submitted to the Director General its letter of ratification 
of the Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety of 
Radioactive Waste Management. A Presidential decree on the safety of radioactive waste 
management was expected to enter into force in the near future. 
68. Despite isolated differences among States party to the NPT, a consensus had been 
achieved at the 2000 NPT Review Conference on measures to strengthen Agency safeguards. 
The NPT and the strengthened safeguards system had to be universally applied if their 
credibility was to be maintained and even enhanced. To that end, all States that had 
concluded safeguards agreements should sign additional protocols. Greece had signed the 
additional protocol to the safeguards agreement between the 13 non-nuclear-weapon States of 
the European Union, EURATOM and the Agency, and had ratified the CTBT and committed 
to it a seismological station on Crete. The entry into force of the latter Treaty, the conclusion 
of negotiations on a fissile material cut-off treaty, and the revitalization of the disarmament 
process were essential steps in completing the NPT regime. 
69. With regard to illicit trafficking of nuclear material, Greece welcomed the Agency's 
database programme through which assistance was provided to States with the secure 
management of nuclear material. Setting up efficient national physical protection systems 
based on international standards seemed to be the best way to prevent illicit trafficking. The 
revision of the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material could widen the 
scope of its application to cover not only transboundary movements of nuclear material but 
also storage of such material, including for domestic use. 
70. The Greek Atomic Energy Commission inspected all imported cargoes of scrap metal 
for the possible presence of radioactive substances or radiation sources. The customs services 
and the industries processing scrap metals had likewise been equipped with proper 
instrumentation for detecting radioactive substances. Much effort had also been devoted to 
the early detection of increased radioactivity levels in the Greek environment through the 
installation of a telemetric network covering the whole country. 
71. The voluntary contributions used to finance the technical co-operation programme kept 
on increasing year after year, in contrast to the Regular Budget which had been held to zero 
real growth for quite some time. Greece contributed to both the Regular Budget and the TCF 
and hosted Agency training courses under its fellowship programme. The Greek Atomic 
Energy Commission had received Agency assistance with the operation of a secondary 
standard dosimetry laboratory which had been incorporated in the IAEA and WHO SSDL 
network. 



72. Finally, the key to the AgencyÂs success was to ensure that the programme met the real 
needs of Member States while maintaining cost-effectiveness. 


Mr. Ryzhov (Russian Federation) took the chair. 

73. Mr. FERRER (Argentina) said that the new formula for the financing of 
safeguards meant that several countries, including his own, would be paying more. His 
country did not consider it either a good or a just formula, but was making a special effort to 
support it and believed that that effort should be taken into account in a number of ways. 
74. A system for periodic evaluation of safeguards costs should be put in place, allowing 
for adjustments to be made based on actual implementation and economic developments in 
Member States. Zero real growth should be strictly adhered to in future programmes and 
budgets. The Secretariat should intensify its efforts to achieve greater efficiency in the use of 
the funds allocated for safeguards. No additional costs should be incurred from the 
application of additional protocols, and the implementation of a truly integrated safeguards 
system should accordingly be monitored. With such measures, and the introduction of new 
methods and techniques, existing concerns about continuing reliance on extrabudgetary 
resources for financing of the Agency's core activities could be met. It was also important to 
maintain a proper balance between safeguards activities and promotional activities. 
75. Argentina and Brazil had initiated contacts with the Secretariat with a view to signing 
an additional protocol. Argentina welcomed the progress made in the co-operation between 
ABACC and the IAEA on the application of safeguards and hoped that it would develop 
further, thus preventing duplication of effort. 
76. Turning to developments inside Argentina, he noted that the funding had been approved 
for the CAREM prototype 25 MW(e) low-power reactor, and an interministerial committee 
had been set up to make recommendations regarding the options for the completion of the 
Atucha II nuclear power plant. A new PHWR fuel called CARA had been developed for use 
in all of ArgentinaÂs reactors. It was easy to manufacture and handle and should, therefore, 
help reduce costs and improved the competitiveness of nuclear power. The two nuclear 
power plants already in operation, which used domestically produced fuel and heavy water, 
were furnishing approximately 11% of electricity generated in the country. 
77. In the field of non-power applications, boron neutron capture therapy was being used to 
treat cerebral tumours. The National Atomic Energy Commission had substantially increased 
production of industrial cobalt-60 sources that were being marketed internationally. All the 
above-mentioned nuclear activities were being carried out under the control of an independent 
regulatory body. 
78. His country had continued its co-operation activities within the Agency's technical 
co-operation programme and ARCAL. It particularly valued the training offered to scientists 
through the Agency. A bilateral co-operation agreement on co-operation in the peaceful uses 
of nuclear energy had recently been signed with Bulgaria. Argentina was particularly proud 
to report that one of its firms had recently been awarded a contract for the construction of a 
research reactor in Australia. 



79. Use of nuclear energy was closely linked to public acceptance thereof, and therefore to 
nuclear safety. On 31 July 2000, the Argentine National Congress had ratified the Joint 
Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste 
Management, whose rapid entry into force should help improve safety of nuclear activities 
worldwide. In December 2000, his country would be hosting the International Conference of 
National Regulatory Authorities with Competence in the Safety of Radiation Sources and the 
Security of Radioactive Materials. It participated in Agency meetings on the formulation of 
nuclear, radiation and waste safety standards and, like other countries in the region, it 
attached great importance to the safe transport of radioactive material and felt that the 
dialogue with the shipping countries should continue with a view to strengthening the 
relevant regulations. 
80. Mr. URRUELA PRADO (Guatemala) said that despite the significant efforts 
made to stop the nuclear arms race in the 55 years since the end of humanity's worst armed 
conflict, a new millennium was beginning without nuclear weapons proliferation having been 
curbed or disarmament achieved. He appealed to the parties concerned to end the deadlock 
and make good the commitment to disarmament contained in the NPT. 
81. Guatemala welcomed the START III negotiations between the United States of America 
and the Russian Federation and found the ratification of START II by both parties 
encouraging. So far, 160 States had signed the CTBT. However, the continuing refusal of 
the United States Senate to ratify the Treaty was cause for concern. Moreover, not all of the 
44 States whose ratification was required for the Treaty to enter into force had so far ratified 
it, and he appealed to the remaining States in that group to do so. Under Article 18 of the 
Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, merely signing a treaty obliged a State to refrain 
from defeating its object and purpose. 
82. The pioneering role of Latin America and the Caribbean in the establishment of 
nuclear-weapon-free zones was a source of satisfaction for Guatemala. It accordingly 
supported unequivocally all efforts to establish such zones in other areas of the world and 
welcomed the progress made in that direction in Central and South East Asia. The same did 
not hold, unfortunately, for South Asia or the Middle East, and he called on Member States in 
those regions to step up their efforts to make nuclear-weapon-free zones a reality. The 
objective should be to use nuclear energy for the development of humanity and not for its 
destruction. 
83. The final document adopted at the 2000 NPT Review Conference was a consensus text, 
but it did not represent real progress. Nevertheless, something had still been achieved 
through the unequivocal commitment of the nuclear-weapon States to the total elimination of 
their nuclear arsenals. 
84. His country's interest was exclusively in the peaceful use of nuclear energy, and the 
technical assistance it had received from the Agency had been devoted to national 
development objectives to benefit the greatest possible number of Guatemalans and improve 
their quality of life. Technical co-operation projects carried out in recent years had had a 
growing impact in such fields as human health, electricity generation, agriculture, hydrology, 



the environment and radiation safety and protection. The legal framework for radiation 
protection was already in force, an indispensable instrument for the protection of the public, 
occupationally exposed workers and the environment. Guatemala was interested in pursuing 
and expanding its technical co-operation activities to improve the use of nuclear technology, 
as it had demonstrated by making available its infrastructure for national and regional training 
courses and visits by fellowship holders. 
85. His country had been chosen many times to organize meetings under the ARCAL 
programme which had provided assistance to Guatemala in such areas as training, 
improvement of radiation protection, maintenance of nuclear instrumentation and laboratory 
analysis, plant breeding, quality control in radiotherapy and nuclear medicine, nuclear 
applications in agriculture and human health, radiopharmaceutical quality control and 
production, and exchange of information. Conventional and nuclear techniques had been 
applied to the study of pollution in certain water bodies in Guatemala. Two geothermal 
power plants had been installed in the country and another 13 possible sites were being 
explored. Co-operation with the agricultural authorities of the United States of America and 
Mexico had yielded successful results in the fight against the Mediterranean fruit fly. 
86. His Government felt it was important that a balance be maintained in the distribution of 
the Agency's resources so as to ensure that the maximum number of requests for assistance 
could be met. Guatemala, for its part, would provide the necessary economic support for 
technical co-operation projects and make its assessed contribution to the Regular Budget 
when feasible. 
87. Mr. CHAMBESHI (Zambia), referring to the initiatives undertaken in recent 
years to strengthen international co-operation in radiation protection and safe disposal of 
radioactive waste, said that safety was of crucial importance in building public confidence in 
the use of nuclear science and technology. Measures initiated in Zambia to address illicit 
trafficking in nuclear material and radiation sources included information workshops for 
major stakeholders. 
88. His country was happy with the focus of the Agency's programme and budget for 2001 
and believed it would facilitate the strengthening of technical co-operation activities, which 
were of great benefit to Member States. Building on the assistance it had received from the 
Agency, Zambia had made some notable achievements in recent years, including the 
production of radiosterilized tissue grafts, of potato seedlings at the plant tissue culture 
facility and of two improved bean varieties via radiation-induced mutation. The capacity had 
been established to carry out measurements of industrial aerosols and radon at underground 
mining sites in order to protect workers. 
89. Zambia supported AFRA and was especially interested in projects aimed at controlling 
tsetse flies and malaria-carrying mosquitoes using the SIT, which should make a significant 
contribution to sustainable economic development. Any approach that targeted only a few 
countries in a single region was doomed to failure, and AFRA was therefore to be 
congratulated for setting up specialized teams in such fields as radiotherapy, dam leakage and 
nuclear medicine, using expertise and capacity available in the African region. In the past 



year Zambia had received AFRA missions in instrumentation and conditioning of radium 
sources, and Zambian professionals had attended a number of AFRA meetings and courses. 
He hoped that support for AFRA would continue to enable it to implement the projects 
planned for 2001 and 2002. 
90. In conclusion, his country would be contributing its full share of the target for the TCF 
for 2001. 
91. Mr. GONZÃLEZ ANINAT (Chile) said that, in order to counter public fear of 
nuclear energy, States should endeavour to promote public awareness of the benefits nuclear 
technology brought in such fields as human health, agriculture, industry, water resource 
management and other economic and social sectors, highlighting the Âhuman dimensionÂ of 
the peaceful use of nuclear energy. With that in mind, Chile and Peru were co-sponsoring a 
seminar on the benefits of nuclear energy, to be held in 2001, for which they hoped to receive 
IAEA support. 
92. The compromise reached on the financing of technical co-operation and safeguards had 
required concessions from all sides, especially the developing countries, and Chile hoped it 
would not result merely in an increase in contributions and a corresponding increase in 
frustration. The commitments entered into should be fulfilled in order to ensure that an 
increasingly efficient, predictable and secure system for implementing technical co-operation 
activities was in place. Chile had achieved high implementation levels for technical 
co-operation projects, and it paid its contributions to the TCF in full and on time. 
93. His country had also made significant efforts in the safeguards area by supporting the 
abolition of the shielding system that had been in effect for 30 years. That effort, and the 
similar efforts of other countries, should be duly recognized as a contribution towards the 
creation of a more equitable situation within the Agency. 
94. Because Chile had strong concerns about the safe use of nuclear energy, it attached 
great importance to the Agency's work in that field and to the projected measures to 
strengthen international co-operation and revise and update the relevant safety standards and 
the safety guides. 
95. Given ChileÂs geography, the safe transport of radioactive material was a matter of great 
concern to it. Accordingly, it advocated constant improvement of the measures and 
regulations designed to enhance safety in the transport of radioactive waste and irradiated 
nuclear fuel. It welcomed the activities carried out by the Director General pursuant to 
General Conference resolution GC(42)/RES/13 aimed at promoting closer co-operation 
among international organizations active in the field, and resulting in the establishment of 
TranSAS and the organization of training courses on transport of radioactive material. It 
would continue to support the application of the highest international standards in transport 
activities. 
96. The radioactive waste treatment plant Chile had built with IAEA support was operating 
in full compliance with the relevant standards and was providing training services. The 
AgencyÂs co-operation with Member States in the radioactive waste management field was 



essential for the protection of the public and the environment, and for public acceptance of 
nuclear energy. Chile, together with some other Latin American countries, had submitted a 
regional project for the 2001-2002 biennium on storage alternatives for spent research reactor 
fuel. 
97. Stronger commitment and participation from those involved in technical co-operation 
activities were needed if greater efficiency and impact were to be achieved. The Agency was 
to be congratulated on its efforts to focus technical co-operation focus on productive and 
sustainable human development, which was the only framework in which co-operation could 
be translated into concrete benefits for countries. The ARCAL programme had created ties 
that facilitated the co-ordination of activities in a region where differing nuclear development 
levels offered good prospects for horizontal co-operation. There too, it was essential that 
projects were linked to national social and economic programmes from the outset. 
98. Mr. NASSREDDINE (Lebanon) said that Lebanon, which had recovered most of 
the territory occupied since 1978, was still threatened by IsraelÂs nuclear arsenal and 
advanced nuclear facilities. IsraelÂs failure to accede to the NPT and to open its nuclear 
facilities to international inspection posed a threat to peace not only in the region but in the 
world as a whole. LebanonÂs call for the placement of IsraelÂs nuclear facilities under 
international safeguards and the termination of its non-peaceful nuclear programme was 
motivated by its concern for the safety of the peoples of the region and its desire to protect 
water resources and the environment from nuclear pollution. 
99. The Model Project on upgrading of radiation protection infrastructure had allowed 
Lebanon to make significant progress in the establishment of laboratories and the drafting of 
legislation. The Government had submitted a bill to the National Assembly on protection 
against ionizing radiation, pursuant to which a supervisory authority would be established. 
Legislation and regulations governing the use of ionizing radiation sources would also be 
enacted. It was hoped that the bill would be adopted within the next few months. 
100. Turning to technical co-operation activities, he said that development, especially in the 
context of globalization, should be viewed as a right to be enjoyed by every individual. The 
organizations of the United Nations system, including the Agency, had a duty to meet the 
costs of such development, thereby contributing to the preservation of social and economic 
security and world peace. He therefore called on donor countries to increase their 
contributions to the TCF and urged the Agency to appropriate a portion of the Regular Budget 
to the Fund. 
101. Lebanon attached great importance to the promotion of regional co-operation among 
Arab States in West Asia under the auspices of the Agency, which provided a solid basis for 
the efficient and cost-effective implementation of diverse projects. It was in favour of 
increased co-operation between the Agency and the Arab Atomic Energy Agency. In 
particular, the Agency should support the latterÂs projects aimed at protecting the 
environment and providing safe and clean drinking water for the peoples of the region. 



102. In recent years, Lebanon had implemented a number of technical co-operation projects 
with the Agency. The Lebanese atomic energy authority had established several laboratories 
for preliminary analysis of environmental samples and was planning to provide scientific 
services to the public and private sector with the help of experts trained with Agency 
assistance. Owing to the increasing use which was being made of ionizing radiation in 
Lebanon, especially for medical purposes, there was a need for a secondary standard 
dosimetry laboratory, a matter to which he hoped the Agency would give favourable 
consideration. 
103. Mr. CHARRY SAMPER (Colombia) said that, in line with Agency 
recommendations, his country was developing a national programme structure to facilitate the 
definition of priorities in radiation protection, nuclear safety, regulation and control. That 
programme structure would include projects on nuclear applications in human health, the 
environment, the agriculture and stockbreeding sector and hydrology. 
104. A draft law on nuclear safety and radiation protection had been elaborated with Agency 
assistance. The aim was to harmonize criteria, establish competencies, correct legislative 
deficiencies and define responsibilities, in order to promote the safe and sustainable 
development of nuclear technology. In 1999, the Government had assigned the responsibility 
for formulating policy on nuclear energy and handling of radioactive material to the Ministry 
of Energy and Mining. The Directorate for Energy and Gas had been made responsible for 
elaborating regulations. A process of redefinition of regulatory functions, financial 
responsibilities and competencies was under way in which the advice provided by the Agency 
was crucial. 
105. Colombia was working to apply the Agency's recommendations on the safety of 
radiation sources and radioactive waste management. Radioactive material was subject to 
regulation, control and licensing by the Ministry of Energy and Mining; radiation sources for 
use in medicine were subject to additional controls by the Ministry of Health. 
106. One priority over the last two years had been to update the national inventory of 
radiation sources with a view to elaborating, in co-operation with the Agency, a national plan 
for the management of disused sources covering the next two years. The technical 
infrastructure required for the temporary surface storage of over 330 disused 226Ra sources 
was being prepared; other types of disused source were being accepted at the express request 
of the users. 
107. International agreements to improve compliance with nuclear safety standards were 
central to efforts to improve nuclear safety worldwide, thus ensuring that nuclear applications 
contributed to technological, social and economic development. Colombia had started work 
on the legislative arrangements necessary for the signature and ratification of the Early 
Notification and Assistance Conventions. On 29 March 2000, the Constitutional Court had 
accepted the argument put forward by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in favour of simplified 
procedures for the conclusion of other agreements. Such procedures had been used for the 
conclusion of the safeguards agreement with the Agency, which his Government hoped would 
be finalized by the end of the year. 



108. Aware as it was that the Agency could only carry out its functions if States paid their 
contributions in a timely fashion, despite its own financial difficulties Colombia was paying 
its contributions and supporting efforts to obtain better funding, particularly in the field of 
technical co-operation. 
109. Conditions were propitious at the start of the new century for surmounting the twin 
threat that had been hanging over humanity since the discovery of nuclear energy: man-made 
and accidental apocalypse. The necessary instruments to achieve that end were in place; they 
still needed to be implemented. Nuclear energy, freed of that twin threat, should be in a 
position to promote ever more effectively equitable development worldwide. To that end, the 
Agency's work on training of human resources from developing countries, particularly in such 
important areas as health, the environment, industry, education and sustainable development, 
should be reinforced. Advanced technology should be made available through a combination 
of traditional North-South and South-South co-operation. 
110. Finally, Colombia supported the strengthening the safeguards system, even though it 
would clearly necessitate increased budgetary contributions. It was also committed to total 
nuclear disarmament. 
111. Mr. KASTCHIEV (Bulgaria) welcomed the determination expressed by the States 
party to the NPT to work for its strict application. His country had been among the first to 
sign an additional protocol, which had just been ratified. Bulgaria implemented its 
obligations under its safeguards agreement rigorously, as was confirmed by the IAEAÂs 
statement on the results of inspections of its nuclear facilities conducted in 1999. 
112. As a member of the Nuclear Suppliers Group and the Zangger Committee, Bulgaria 
complied strictly with the requirement for comprehensive safeguards as a precondition for 
supply of nuclear material or equipment, and resolutely applied that principle in its foreign 
trade policy. The Agency played an essential role in promoting international co-operation to 
combat illicit trafficking in nuclear material and other radiation sources. Bulgaria 
participated in the IAEA database on illicit trafficking and fully supported the measures taken 
in that field. 
113. With regard to enhancement of the safety of nuclear facilities and installations, the 
Agency was in a position to provide national and international policy-makers with the 
specific information and expertise needed for decisions to be taken on a technical rather than 
a political basis. Efforts in that direction needed to be maintained and strengthened. 
114. The Agency had achieved considerable results with regard to improvement of 
management of the technical co-operation programme and the volume of assistance rendered 
to Member States. Bulgaria was grateful for the assistance it had been given with safety 
enhancement in its nuclear facilities, and in particular for the missions to the Kozloduy 
nuclear power plant. 
115. His country supported the programme and budget for 2001, and it had paid its assessed 
contributions for the current year and its full share of the TCF target for 2000. 



116. Nuclear power continued to play an important role in meeting BulgariaÂs electricity 
demands. In 1999, 43.6% of all electricity generated had been of nuclear origin. The country 
paid a great deal of attention to safe operation of its nuclear facilities and was working on 
improving their safety level. The seismic upgrading of the spent fuel storage facility at the 
Kozloduy nuclear power plant continued, and other reconstruction measures were expected to 
be completed by the end of the year. A radioactive waste processing plant and a processed 
waste storage facility were under construction and should be commissioned in 2001. 
Following the Government's decision to shut down units 1 and 2 of the Kozloduy plant early, 
an administrative structure had been established and plans for its decommissioning, including 
safety requirements, were being elaborated. 
117. The development and upgrading of Bulgarian nuclear legislation in order to bring it 
closer to that of the European Union was continuing. On 10 May 2000, the National 
Assembly had ratified the Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on 
the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management. Draft legislation on the safe use of nuclear 
energy was currently being prepared and he thanked the Agency for its expert assistance in 
that endeavour. 
118. Bulgaria participated actively in the IAEA's regional technical co-operation activities, 
giving high priority to projects relating to nuclear safety, nuclear energy, nuclear medicine 
and legislation. It had a high opinion of, and strongly supported, the Agency's activities 
aimed at promoting international co-operation in the peaceful use of nuclear energy and the 
application of safeguards. 
119. Mr. ALLOTEY (Ghana) said that nuclear energy and technology should be an 
asset to humanity, not its bane. He therefore called on all States to sign and ratify the CTBT, 
the NPT and all treaties aimed at accelerating the process of nuclear disarmament. The 
nuclear-weapon States and non-nuclear-weapon States alike should commit themselves more 
fully to the objective of complete nuclear disarmament in order to promote global peace and a 
congenial environment for economic development and overall social progress. Universal 
application of all rules and regulations contained in the various conventions and treaties 
relating to nuclear disarmament should be fairly and firmly enforced. 
120. States in nuclear-weapon-free zones should be appropriately commended for their bold 
decision to reject weapons of mass destruction in favour of the peaceful use of nuclear 
energy. The international community should support development projects that utilized 
atomic energy for peaceful purposes in such zones in order to motivate other regions to bid 
farewell to nuclear arms. 
121. To continue spending money on strengthening nuclear arsenals while large sections of 
the human community did not have access to potable water was to undermine the worldwide 
campaign for human rights. The successful implementation of the plan for producing potable 
water economically would bring to the doorsteps of ordinary people one of the most 
important products of the peaceful use of nuclear energy. His Government would support any 
joint project aimed at ensuring year-round supplies of water for both domestic and 
agricultural purposes throughout the country. 



122. Ghana gratefully acknowledged the considerable assistance the Agency had provided to 
its Atomic Energy Commission, which was continuing to explore the use of biotechnology 
and related nuclear technologies to achieve increased agricultural output and overall 
socio-economic development. Progress had been made with the control of tsetse flies and in 
the agricultural sector. The National Nuclear Research Institute operated a radiotherapy 
centre and a nuclear medicine unit, and the countryÂs research reactor provided analysis 
facilities for industrial, geological and agricultural samples. GhanaÂs Radiation Protection 
Board had become an important training centre for African fellowship-holders and its 
Biotechnology and Nuclear Research Institute was actively promoting plant tissue culture in 
the African region. 
123. That catalogue of remarkable achievements should not be allowed to give the 
impression that the Ghana Atomic Energy Commission was already firmly on its feet. 
Inadequate financial resources and the lack of appropriate equipment continued to constrain 
its efforts to realize its full potential. The Government of Ghana was resolved to co-operate 
fully with the Agency in supporting the Commission's work and would welcome more 
technical assistance from the Agency and other Member States. In a wider context, the 
Agency could count on GhanaÂs co-operation in pursuing the common objectives of 
promoting the peaceful use of nuclear energy for prosperity, security and peace. 
124. Ms. CARMINE (New Zealand) said that her delegationÂs optimism at the 
previous General Conference regarding the prospects for enhanced security at the start of the 
new millennium had not been misplaced. The outcome of the recent NPT Review Conference 
had exceeded expectations and was of real importance to the Agency. Particularly welcome 
was the new, unequivocal political undertaking given by the five nuclear-weapon States to 
eliminate totally their nuclear arsenals. However, the real challenge lay ahead, for the 
undertakings given had now to be implemented. It was time for the Conference on 
Disarmament to establish a subsidiary body to deal with nuclear disarmament, to resume 
negotiations on a fissile material cut-off treaty and to deal with outer space issues. Equally, 
the CTBT was still to enter into force. Some Member States had yet to fulfil their NPT 
obligations by concluding safeguards agreements, and adherence to the strengthened 
safeguards regime was proceeding all too slowly. New Zealand applauded the welcome 
developments on the Korean Peninsula but regretted the continuing lack of progress on 
safeguards implementation in the DPRK, and the fact that - since December 1998 - the 
Agency had not been in a position to implement its mandate in Iraq under Security Council 
resolutions. 
125. New Zealanders held the Agency in high esteem for its contribution to nuclear 
non-proliferation and disarmament, especially through its verification activities; but its work 
on promoting a global nuclear safety culture was also enormously important. Because her 
country's concern about the effects of nuclear accidents on humanity and the environment ran 
deep, it strongly supported the Agency's work to strengthen international co-operation in 
nuclear, radiation and waste safety and the assistance it provided in the event of accidents. 
126. The South Pacific was a nuclear-weapon-free zone and New Zealand itself was a 
nuclear-free zone, yet it remained at risk from maritime transport of radioactive material 



because it was on one of the shipping routes for nuclear material being returned to Japan 
following reprocessing in Europe. Although the risk was small, the environmental and 
economic impact could be substantial. Its concern was shared by other countries in the 
region, and New Zealand maintained an active dialogue with the shipping States and had 
made some progress in securing prior notification of shipments and agreement to regional 
talks on liability issues. Bilateral and regional efforts to address that issue would be 
strengthened if there was international agreement on a realistic but progressive agenda for 
improving the measures and mechanisms relevant to international maritime transport of 
radioactive material and spent fuel. 
127. The Agency was fulfilling its mandate fully and professionally, but any international 
organization was only as strong as its members were dedicated. The responsibility lay with 
Member States to ensure that the Agency had the resources it needed to meet the high 
expectations that the international community had placed upon it. New Zealand would 
continue to play its part in helping the Agency to meet its important responsibilities. 
128. Mr. THEIN (Myanmar) said that his country highly appreciated the Agency's 
accomplishments in the areas of nuclear non-proliferation, safeguards, radiation and waste 
safety and the promotion of nuclear applications. At the same time, it was important that 
Agency safeguards and verification measures were applied in a non-discriminatory manner 
and in conformity with the relevant provisions of the NPT. 
129. A major contribution by ASEAN to the promotion of regional peace and security was 
the Treaty on the Southeast Asia Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone, which had entered into force 
in 1997. Even before becoming a member of ASEAN, Myanmar had signed the Treaty and 
had been one of the first ASEAN members to ratify it. 
130. The Agency's valuable assistance had enabled his country to make available nuclear 
medicine services, nuclear diagnostic techniques and radiotherapy. In 2000, the IAEA had 
provided Myanmar with a cobalt-60 irradiator which would be used mainly in a tissue bank, 
but also in research and development. The Agency's assistance in other areas, such as food 
and agriculture, industry, education and training, was also having a positive impact on 
national development. 
131. The Agency's involvement in regional co-operation programmes for promoting nuclear 
science and technology was also highly effective and desirable. The RCA, AFRA and 
ARCAL were doing very productive work in their respective regions. 
132. Having embarked on a programme for the promotion of nuclear applications, Myanmar 
was aware of the need for an adequate radiation protection and waste safety infrastructure. 
The elaboration of regulations for the safe use of radiation and atomic energy was nearly 
complete, and he thanked the Agency for its assistance in that work through the interregional 
Model Project on radiation and waste safety infrastructure. 
133. Self-reliance in and sustainability of nuclear applications was important to his country, 
which was just starting out in that field, and had been the topic of a useful international 



workshop held recently in Malaysia. He urged the Secretariat to give priority under the 
technical co-operation programme to projects for least developed Member States. 
134. In conclusion, he assured the Agency of Myanmar's support and expressed the hope that 
it would continue to contribute to the peace, health and prosperity of people throughout the 
world. 
135. Mr. NOBILO (Croatia) said that his country had not only developed a wide range 
of projects that had contributed to the safe use of nuclear energy, it had also harmonized its 
legislation with the Agency's standards and norms. The additional protocol to its safeguards 
agreement had entered into force on 6 July 2000. On 30 August 2000, Croatia had informed 
the depositary State that the internal conditions for acceptance of the amendment to Article VI 
of the Statute had been met. As one of the first countries to finalize that procedure, Croatia 
invited other Member States to ratify the amendment to Article VI as soon as possible. 
136. The NPT Review Conference had proved a milestone on the path towards a better world 
free of nuclear threat. His country had participated actively in it. 
137. As an illustration of the priority his Government attached to the extension of 
international co-operation in all fields he noted that, in June 2000, an international conference 
on the nuclear option in countries with small and medium electricity grids had been held in 
Dubrovnik in close co-operation with the Agency. Croatia had hosted several other meetings 
under Agency auspices and more were planned. 
138. Regional co-operation in waste management was of special interest to Croatia owing to 
its co-ownership with Slovenia of the KrÂko nuclear power plant. The plant was operating 
without major problems. There had been differing opinions on its management which were 
on their way to being resolved and had never threatened its safety 
139. Co-operation between the Agency and Croatian research and educational institutions 
was growing. The number of candidates who had been granted fellowships for training in 
Croatian institutions, and the number of Croatian experts who had attended seminars and 
courses abroad was noteworthy. 
140. The recent visit of an IAEA expert team, and the visit scheduled later that year, would 
create a solid basis for technical co-operation projects that focused even better on Croatia's 
needs and whose implementation should yield good results in the fields of waste management, 
radiation protection, nuclear medicine and nuclear power, as well as in demining efforts. 
141. In conclusion, he stressed Croatia's commitment to continuing its co-operation with the 
Agency and other Member States in the peaceful use of nuclear energy. 


The meeting rose at 7.25 p.m.

REQUEST FOR THE RESTORATION OF VOTING RIGHTS 

1. The PRESIDENT said that at its meeting that morning the General Committee 
had had before it a request from Belarus for the restoration of voting rights under Article 
XIX.A of the Statute. The Committee had recommended that, in view of the continued 
adherence by Belarus to its payment plan agreement with the Agency, Belarus should be 
permitted to vote during the present session of the General Conference. It had further 
recommended that BelarusÂs right to vote should be restored until the end of its payment plan 
on the understanding that Belarus continued to meet the requirements of the payment plan and 
that the Secretariat would report annually on the status of the payment plan. 
2. He took it that the General Conference wished to accept the General CommitteeÂs 
recommendation. 
3. It was so decided. 


ELECTION OF MEMBERS TO THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS 

(GC(44)/10 and 22) 

4. The PRESIDENT recalled that in 1989 the General Conference had approved a 
procedure whereby, when there was agreement regarding the candidate or candidates from a 
particular area, no secret ballot would be held; balloting would only take place for those areas 
where no candidate had been agreed upon. That procedure considerably facilitated the 
rational use of the General ConferenceÂs time. Accordingly, he proposed that Rule 79 of the 
Rules of Procedure of the General Conference, which provided that elections to the Board 
should be by secret ballot, be suspended in respect of those areas for which there was 
agreement. 
5. He was happy to report that agreement had been reached in all area groups on their 
candidates for the vacancies to be filled. 
6. Drawing attention to document GC(44)/10, containing a list of the Agency Member 
States which the Board of Governors had designated to serve on the Board from the end of the 
ConferenceÂs present session until the end of the forty-fifth (2001) regular session, he recalled 
that, under Rule 83 of the Rules of Procedure, he had to inform the General Conference of the 
elective places on the Board which had to be filled. To that end, document GC(44)/22 had 
been prepared; it indicated that the Conference had to elect eleven members to the Board from 
the seven categories listed. 
7. He took it that the General Conference wished to elect Argentina, Mexico and Peru to 
the three vacant seats for Latin America. 
8. Argentina, Mexico and Peru were duly elected. 
9. The PRESIDENT took it that the General Conference wished to elect Ireland and 
Switzerland to the two vacant seats for Western Europe. 



10. Ireland and Switzerland were duly elected. 
11. The PRESIDENT took it that the General Conference wished to elect Ukraine to 
the vacant seat for Eastern Europe. 
12. Ukraine was duly elected. 
13. The PRESIDENT took it that the General Conference wished to elect Ghana and 
the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya to the two vacant seats for Africa. 
14. Ghana and the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya were duly elected. 
15. The PRESIDENT took it that the General Conference wished to elect Pakistan to 
the vacant seat for the Middle East and South Asia. 
16. Pakistan was duly elected. 
17. The PRESIDENT took it that the General Conference wished to elect Thailand to 
the vacant seat for South East Asia and the Pacific. 
18. Thailand was duly elected. 
19. The PRESIDENT took it that the General Conference wished to elect Egypt to the 
floating seat for Africa/MESA/SEAP, which it was the turn of a member from Africa to fill. 
20. Egypt was duly elected. 


GENERAL DEBATE AND ANNUAL REPORT FOR 1999 (resumed) 

(GC(44)/4) 

21. Mr. PATHMANATHAN (Sri Lanka) welcomed Azerbaijan, Tajikistan and the 
Central African Republic to membership of the Agency. 
22. Among the many threats to international peace and security, terrorism - one of the most 
heinous crimes that could be committed against innocent civilians - had become an issue of 
critical concern. The adoption by the United Nations of the International Convention for the 
Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism was accordingly most welcome. 
23. The threat posed to humanity by nuclear weapons must not be underestimated. His 
country was pleased to note that the number of signatories to the NPT had increased to 187, 
and it hoped that action would be taken immediately to initiate the proposed fissile material 
cut-off treaty. It welcomed the Agency's efforts to strengthen the safeguards system and 
would take the necessary steps to sign and ratify the additional protocol at the earliest 
possible date. 
24. Sri Lanka had demonstrated its recognition of the CTBTÂs importance for ensuring a 
nuclear-weapon-free world by being one of the first countries to sign that treaty, on 



24 October 1996, and by entering into an agreement with the CTBTO for setting up a 
monitoring station under the international monitoring system. 
25. However, the existence in the Middle East of nuclear facilities that were not subject to 
safeguards posed a security concern that could not be disregarded. It was in the interests of 
all countries in the region to support the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the 
Middle East. 
26. The Agency's technical co-operation programme had enabled Sri Lanka to acquire the 
capability of using nuclear technology to improve health care facilities and agricultural and 
industrial productivity. His Government wished to express its appreciation to the Government 
of India for supporting a footnote-a/ project. Non-power applications of nuclear technology 
were of great importance for most Member States and that fact should be given due 
consideration in the preparation of the Agency's budget. 
27. The Model Project concept and Country Programme Frameworks would undoubtedly 
enhance the socio-economic benefits and end-user orientation of the technical co-operation 
programme. The CPF for Sri Lanka had been finalized and priority areas for future 
co-operation identified. 
28. It was his country's view that in order to ensure self-reliance and sustainability, national 
nuclear institutes should establish strong links with potential users of nuclear technology. 
The Sri Lankan Atomic Energy Authority had managed to increase its income to about 35% 
of its operational expenses by initiating scientific programmes of national relevance. He 
thanked the Government of Malaysia for holding a very successful seminar on the self-
reliance and sustainability of national nuclear institutes. 
29. His Government had increased the financial and other resources allocated to science and 
technology in recognition of that sector's importance for national development. High priority 
had been given to infrastructure and human resources development, which would enhance the 
Atomic Energy Authority's contribution to national development through the use of nuclear 
technology. 
30. In spite of the financial constraints Sri Lanka faced as a result of its difficult security 
situation, his Government had agreed to double its payments of assessed programme costs to 
the Agency so as to settle the arrears more quickly. 
31. Technical assistance received by Sri Lanka under the interregional projects on 
strengthening radiation protection and waste management infrastructures had made it possible 
significantly to improve the country's regulatory programme. New radiation protection 
regulations had been approved by Parliament, and all the country's radiation sources had been 
prepared for notification, authorization and inspection. 
32. Regional co-operation under the RCA, had brought participating countries considerable 
benefits in activities ranging from nuclear applications in medicine, agriculture, industry and 
the environment to radiation protection and nuclear power. Sri Lanka welcomed the 
improvements being made in the RCA's management structure and believed that closer 



consultation in decision-making on the implementation of RCA programmes should be 
established between the Agency and Member States. UNDPÂs decision to discontinue its 
support for the joint UNDP/RCA project on sustainable industrial development, despite a very 
favourable mid-term review, was a matter of concern, and he requested the Agency to take up 
the matter with UNDP at the highest possible level. 
33. In conclusion, he pledged his Government's active support for the programme and 
activities of the Agency. 
34. Mr. KINGÂORIAH (Kenya), after welcoming the new members to the Agency, 
said that the IAEA was undoubtedly one of the most efficient and productive of the technical 
agencies set up by the United Nations. In particular, he wished to commend its Department 
of Technical Co-operation for attaining a high implementation rate in 1999. Technical 
co-operation activities had assumed greater importance in his country owing to growing 
challenges in health care, food and agriculture, industry, energy and research. Benefits 
derived from such activities included manpower development, technology transfer and 
improvements in agricultural production, animal health, human health, nuclear safety and 
waste disposal technology. 
35. The Agency's support for regional arrangements like ARCAL, RCA and AFRA attested 
to its visionary approach to regional challenges. Its activities under AFRA had greatly 
enhanced integration and harmony in the African region, with a number of countries 
becoming Partners in Development. Kenya looked forward to the expansion of projects under 
AFRA. The increasing use of TCDC was encouraging, as it would ultimately ensure 
optimum use of the scarce available resources and increase the impact of the technical co-
operation programme. 
36. His country strongly supported AFRA and believed that the identification of centres of 
excellence should be vigorously pursued. Conscious of its responsibility to share with other 
developing countries its modest resources, expertise and experience in the peaceful use of 
nuclear energy, it was offering to IAEA fellows placements in institutions in various fields of 
nuclear science and technology. 
37. Nuclear techniques were being used in his country to promote the production of high-
yield, drought-resistant cultivars, to measure and monitor nutrients in soil/plant systems, to 
improve the diagnosis and control of livestock diseases and to increase milk and meat 
production. The Government was committed to eradicating the tsetse fly and trypanosomiasis 
using the sterile insect technique. A project for its application in the Lambwe Valley was 
being developed, but to ensure the required rate of implementation, the IAEA should consider 
sending experts in tsetse fly breeding who had sufficient knowledge of local conditions to 
advise local scientists. 
38. In the past year, Kenya had further expanded the application of non-destructive testing 
techniques for quality control and the establishment of acceptable standards for industrial 
output. It was most grateful for the assistance of the United States of America and the 
Agency in that area. In its efforts to reinforce the nuclear technology manpower base, the 



Government had emphasized the maintenance of modern instrumentation, training and 
appropriate analytical techniques. 
39. The application of nuclear techniques to environmental conservation and health had 
been promoted. Health care delivery, including the provision of radiotherapy services, had 
been improved. Cervical cancer affected many women in their prime. Early diagnosis and 
treatment of various forms of cancer at the regional level was to be pursued, and additional 
facilities for nuclear medicine were to be established with the involvement of the private 
sector. 
40. The exploration and optimum utilization of freshwater resources had high priority on 
Kenya's development agenda, and the role of nuclear techniques in that area was of great 
importance. Kenya was participating in the regional project on the application of isotope 
hydrology to water resource development and management. The rational exploitation of 
groundwater resources in the target area would do much to improve the livelihood and 
security of the population. 
41. The efforts to strengthen the Radiation Protection Board - whose task it was to 
formulate nuclear safety and radiation protection policies - had continued. Its work had been 
instrumental in ensuring the safe handling, storage and use of radiation sources. Kenya was 
determined to comply with the safety standards set internationally. 
42. His Government also intended to request expert advice from the Agency on the 
acquisition and utilization of nuclear research reactors, which it believed would foster better 
public understanding of the benefits of nuclear energy. 
43. Kenya remained steadfast in its support for total nuclear disarmament and nuclear 
non-proliferation in all dimensions. The safeguards system was a tool for achieving 
non-proliferation, and nuclear security in tomorrow's world depended on its implementation 
in a clear, fair and transparent manner. In its efforts to provide credible assurances about 
declared and undeclared nuclear activities, the Agency should take full advantage of the latest 
applicable technology in order to accomplish its tasks as effectively, efficiently and 
non-intrusively as possible. 
44. He commended the Director General for his efforts to increase the proportion of women 
professionals in the Agency and expressed the hope that in the recruitment of personnel at 
senior managerial and decision-making levels, candidates from all regions and subregions 
would be accorded due consideration. 
45. In conclusion, he said that Kenya supported a balance between the Agency's regulatory 
and promotional functions and thought that deliberate efforts should be made to assist 
Member States that were pursuing peaceful applications of nuclear technology. 
46. Mr. LAANEMÃE (Estonia), having welcomed the new members and endorsed 
the statement made on behalf of the European Union and associated countries, said that unlike 
most of its neighbouring States, Estonia had no operating nuclear facilities. Its main interest 
was to ensure the safety of the large amount of radioactive waste stored in its territory without 



the knowledge or approval of the inhabitants and of the small additional amount from the use 
of radioactive materials in peaceful applications. Its unconditional support for the Agency's 
endeavours was fuelled by the conviction that nuclear energy should be used to benefit 
mankind. The Agency should pursue the implementation of the Action Plan for the Safety of 
Radiation Sources and the Security of Radioactive Materials. 
47. Estonia looked forward to the integration of safeguards into one strengthened, efficient 
and cost-effective system. Its safeguards agreement with the Agency had entered into force 
on 24 November 1997. The additional protocol had been signed on 13 April 2000 and the 
preparation of the legislation needed to implement it had already begun. As one of the 
54 States Party to the NPT that had concluded additional protocols, Estonia was concerned 
that a substantial number had not yet fulfilled their obligations. In further compliance with its 
own NPT commitments, Estonia had adopted new legislation on the import, export and transit 
of strategic goods and the specific procedures required to implement it had been approved. 
48. His country was making steady progress in incorporating internationally accepted safety 
standards into its national legislation. In 2001, a new draft of the Radiation Protection Act 
which took account of present experience and European Union requirements would be 
submitted to Parliament. Several other acts awaiting approval in 2001 concerned radioactive 
waste, intervention in the case of radiological emergency, and supervision and control of 
radiation safety and radiation sources. He thanked the Agency for providing expert advice 
and training for Estonian specialists and welcomed its intention to continue technical 
co-operation in that area. 
49. On 26 September 1995, Estonia had taken over responsibility for the former Soviet 
nuclear submarine training centre in Paldiski. Considerable progress had since been made 
towards decommissioning and all solid radioactive waste left on the site had now been 
conditioned. The Paldiski site served as an interim storage facility for all radioactive waste 
generated in Estonia. Although it was suitable for fulfilling that function for decades, his 
country fully recognized the need to explore options for the establishment of a final repository 
for radioactive waste. The present condition and future management of the sarcophagi 
covering the two reactors also needed to be assessed. 
50. Estonia welcomed the inclusion in the Agency's technical co-operation programme for 
2001-2002 of two projects relating to the use of radioactive substances in medicine. It 
attached great importance to the establishment of a national calibration laboratory for ionizing 
radiation and therefore found the continuation of the subregional co-operation project on that 
topic most welcome. Today, his country was no longer just a recipient of technical 
co-operation but an active partner, offering facilities for fellowships and scientific visits for 
specialists from other countries. It would continue to participate in the organization of 
seminars and training courses in co-operation with the Agency. 
51. In conclusion, he commended the Agency on its efforts to ensure the peaceful use of 
nuclear energy and reiterated Estonia's firm commitment to doing its utmost to achieve that 
goal. 



52. Mr. SAIDOV (Uzbekistan), after welcoming Tajikistan, Azerbaijan and the 
Central African Republic to the Agency, said that radiation protection and nuclear safety, 
physical protection and environmental protection were key elements in UzbekistanÂs 
approach to nuclear energy, overseen by a number of special bodies established under the 
Agency for Supervision of Industrial Safety and Mining, the Ministry of Health, the State 
Committee for Environmental Protection, the State Committee on Geology and the Ministry 
of Emergencies. The first-named agency was the regulatory body for nuclear safety and 
radiation protection, and as such was empowered to draft and introduce regulations and 
standards, carry out safety assessments, issue licences, undertake inspections and monitor 
compliance with obligations relating to non-proliferation and physical protection. That 
agency was also responsible for establishing a system of accounting and control of nuclear 
materials and ionizing radiation sources and for regulating the safe transport of nuclear and 
other hazardous materials. 
53. Soon after becoming independent, Uzbekistan had enacted legislation relating to 
nuclear safety, and since joining the Agency it had set up important components of its 
radiation protection infrastructure with the AgencyÂs help. 
54. In view of its richness in natural resources and economic potential Uzbekistan had 
many companies using modern technology involving radioisotope applications which had 
implications for radiation safety and for the regulation of imports and exports of radioactive 
and nuclear materials. The laws adopted in Uzbekistan in that connection complied with 
international conventions and agreements, such as the Convention on the Physical Protection 
of Nuclear Material, the Convention on Nuclear Safety, the Paris Convention on Third Party 
Liability in the Field of Nuclear Energy, the Convention on Early Notification of a Nuclear 
Accident and the Vienna Convention on Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage. 
55. However, work needed to be continued on the drafting of regulations for the transport 
and handling of nuclear and radioactive substances. 
56. In addition, qualified Uzbek staff were receiving training in countries with developed 
radiation safety infrastructures and had proven to be well prepared for that training. Several 
projects had been developed with the Agency aimed at improving the use of radioisotopic 
diagnosis methods in cancer cases. There was also co-operation in the applications of 
isotopic techniques in food, water and agriculture, and a study of pollution in the Aral Sea 
basin had been undertaken. 
57. However, essential projects were being hampered by shortages of equipment and 
financial resources. Issues of particular concern to Uzbekistan at present included the 
disposal of spent nuclear fuel and the recultivation of land at former uranium mines. The 
tailings ponds of the Maili-Suu, Chorkesar and Yangiabad mines and of the 
ÂKizilkumredmetzolotoÂ company were major sources of environmental pollution that might 
affect the life and health of thousands of people unless action was taken urgently. 
58. In conclusion, he paid tribute to the donor countries and the Agency Secretariat for their 
help which, his delegation hoped now that the necessary legislation had been enacted, could 



henceforth be relied upon to enhance radiation and nuclear safety in Uzbekistan. The 
concerns over nuclear waste management, particularly the disposal of spent research reactor 
fuel, would remain, though his country hoped that concrete assistance would be forthcoming 
with regard to the problem of former uranium mines. 
59. Mr. NIÃO DE GUZMÃN (Bolivia) said that his country steadfastly supported the 
worldwide application of safeguards as part of the Agency's task in establishing an 
appropriate framework for maintaining nuclear security and preventing the misuse of nuclear 
energy and materials. Although it saw no real reason to abolish the shielding system for the 
financing of safeguards, which had been applied for over thirty years, in the interests of 
consensus it had supported the proposal to that effect made in the Board of Governors by the 
Chairman. That concession represented a large financial sacrifice by the developing countries 
and should be matched by a reciprocal gesture from the nuclear-weapon States in the form of 
elimination or reduction of nuclear arsenals. 
60. His country participated, to the extent of its capacity, in the Agency's technical 
co-operation programmes, including bilateral ones implemented in Bolivia under which 
efficient, useful and practical projects had been carried out, such as the ones on improving 
Andean livestock reproduction and on the diagnosis of ChagasÂs disease using nuclear 
medicine. Bolivia's participation in regional co-operation programmes had likewise been 
constructive. Horizontal co-operation among countries of a region was an excellent example 
of how continuous and effective development could be achieved on the basis of common 
sociological, cultural and developmental elements. Co-operation from developed countries 
was equally effective, however, and should not be overlooked. 
61. Turning to the financing of technical co-operation, he thanked Member States that were 
contributing their full share to the TCF. Bolivia was confident that the Secretariat would 
continue to give due attention to countriesÂ needs, particularly in such areas as safety, water 
resources, human health and the environment, in all of which peaceful uses of nuclear energy 
could give practical impetus to development objectives. Appropriate steps should be taken to 
prevent a decline in the level of the TCF and he accordingly appealed to Member States to 
pay their contributions in full. 
62. Mr. BAHRAN (Yemen), expressed support for the AgencyÂs activities aimed at 
developing international co-operation in the areas of nuclear, radiation and waste safety, the 
transport of radioactive materials, the strengthening of the safeguards system and the 
enhancement of its effectiveness. He also supported the AgencyÂs action against illicit 
trafficking in nuclear materials and other radioactive substances. 
63. As the escalation of the nuclear arms race in any part of the world was a source of 
unrest and instability and a threat to human life and the environment, Yemen strongly 
supported nuclear disarmament, universal adherence to the NPT and the placement of all 
nuclear facilities, in every State without exception, under international supervision in the form 
of Agency safeguards. In 1979 Yemen had been one of the first countries in the region to 
ratify the NPT, and it had been scheduled to sign a safeguards agreement in early October 
1980, but institutional shortcomings had prevented it from doing so at that time. However, 



following the establishment of the National Nuclear Energy Commission, the legislative and 
institutional obstacles had been eliminated and he had pleasure in announcing that Yemen 
would be signing a safeguards agreement with the Agency during the present session of the 
General Conference, thus reaffirming its commitment to the application of the NPT. He 
called on all States without exception to follow suit. 
64. Yemen welcomed all serious initiatives aimed at promoting dialogue among the parties 
to conflicts on the basis of international legal norms and the legitimate rights of peoples. 
While it noted that some progress had been made in the peace process in the Middle East, it 
wished to stress the importance of defending the legitimate right of the Arab Palestinian 
people to the establishment of an independent State with its capital in Jerusalem. It also 
urged the international community to end the ongoing sufferings of the Iraqi people, which 
weighed heavily on the conscience of humanity as a whole. 
65. Yemen called on the Agency to take appropriate steps to persuade Israel to sign the 
NPT and thereby end the nuclear threat to the peoples of the Middle East region and to world 
peace. 
66. As President Salih of Yemen had stated at the United Nations Millennium Summit, the 
last decade of the twentieth century had opened up a new era for Yemen as a united 
democratic State which respected press freedom, womenÂs participation in political life and 
human rights in general. Yemen had entered the twenty-first century at peace with itself and 
its neighbours. It had signed border agreements with Saudi Arabia and Oman and solved its 
dispute with Eritrea through international arbitration, thus reaffirming its commitment to the 
peaceful settlement of disputes and to regional peace and stability, including the safety of 
international shipping in the Bab al-Mandab straits. Yemen had held the first direct 
competitive presidential election in its modern history and under a new Local Authority Act 
the Yemeni people would have the opportunity to elect local representatives to run their 
affairs on a decentralized basis. 
67. Yemen would continue to pursue policies of economic, financial and administrative 
reform oriented towards social and economic development, exploiting the potential of modern 
technology and incorporating the peaceful uses of nuclear energy in its economic 
development programme. A major challenge for the National Atomic Energy Commission, 
following the qualitative legislative and institutional development achieved through patience 
and compromise, consisted in building a solid infrastructure, introducing radiation protection 
regulations and promoting peaceful applications of nuclear energy for the benefit of the 
population as a whole. Yemen counted on the support of its neighbours and friends as well as 
the Agency in implementing development projects in areas such as health, agriculture, the 
environment and water resources. 
68. Yemen was deeply grateful to the Director General and the Department of Technical 
Co-operation for their assistance, particularly in connection with the radiation protection 
infrastructure programme. It urged the Director General and the Board of Governors to 
strengthen the Department of Technical Co-operation by increasing its material and human 
resources, because the AgencyÂs role in that area was of vital importance, especially to the 



developing countries. Projects such as the building of a cancer radiotherapy or nuclear 
medicine centre, or the use of nuclear technology to produce mutations of local plant or 
animal species or for isotope hydrology in arid or semi-arid countries, played a creative 
humanitarian role that was fully consistent with the spirit and purpose of the United Nations 
and the resolutions adopted at the Millennium Summit. 
69. Mr. BOLD (Mongolia), after welcoming Azerbaijan, Tajikistan and the Central 
African Republic as new members, said that IAEA safeguards were a crucial element in 
promoting nuclear non-proliferation. Mongolia was in full compliance with the NPT and the 
CTBT and, as one of the first 63 States to ratify the CTBT, accorded the utmost importance to 
its early entry into force. It was now making all the necessary arrangements with a view to 
concluding as soon as possible an additional protocol to its safeguards agreement on the basis 
of the Model Additional Protocol. 
70. Humankind had achieved a great deal in the application of science and technology, and 
particularly in the use of nuclear energy. Further development of nuclear technology in the 
new millennium should be aimed at improving the quality of human life. Mongolia sought 
new avenues for the development of nuclear energy which would, it firmly believed, make a 
major contribution to resolving the country's critical energy situation. To that end, it needed 
professional advice, support and technical assistance from the Agency. It looked forward to 
conducting a national programme to develop a safe and secure nuclear reactor and nuclear 
fuel under the technical co-operation programme. 
71. The implementation of various technical co-operation projects in such fields as human 
resource development, nuclear technology support and uranium evaluation, as well as human 
health and agriculture, had been particularly fruitful. Mongolia looked forward to increased 
support from the Agency and to active co-operation under the RCA, a useful mechanism for 
nuclear technology transfer benefiting countries in the Asia and Pacific region. 
72. Notwithstanding the financial difficulties that Mongolia faced, it undertook to pay its 
full contributions to both the Regular Budget and the Technical Co-operation Fund. 
73. His country commended the IAEA on its work to develop nuclear-weapon-free zones. 
He thanked the Agency for its valuable assistance in the preparation of the legislation on 
Mongolia's nuclear-weapon-free status, which had been adopted by Parliament in 
February 2000. Arrangements were now being made to attain recognition of that status at the 
international level. 
74. Mr. AL-SHAMAYLEH (Jordan) welcomed Tajikistan, Azerbaijan and the 
Central African Republic as new members. Their accession brought the AgencyÂs total 
membership to 130, a figure that attested to countriesÂ growing esteem for the Agency and its 
vital role in spreading and developing the peaceful uses of nuclear energy, enhancing nuclear 
safety and the safety of radioactive sources and materials, and preventing the proliferation of 
nuclear weapons by means of its strengthened safeguards system. 
75. In the century since the discovery of radioactivity, nuclear energy had served many 
beneficial purposes. But since the middle of the twentieth century, it had also been used to 



build up huge arsenals of nuclear weapons. It was therefore essential, at the start of the new 
millennium, to strengthen the peaceful uses of nuclear energy and prevent its exploitation for 
non-peaceful purposes, eliminating the nuclear threat entirely from every region of the world. 
76. Since the 1950s, Jordan had taken a keen interest in the peaceful use of radiation, 
especially for medical purposes. In the 1970s, it had begun to use isotope technology in 
studies of surface water and groundwater. In the following two decades, it had extended the 
applications of nuclear energy to industry, agriculture, earth sciences, scientific research and 
other areas. At the same time, it had developed legislation, supervision, certification and 
training to meet the growing need for expertise. A Nuclear Energy Department had been 
formed in the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources in the 1980s and preparations were 
under way for the establishment of an independent national nuclear energy authority. 
77. Jordan had received effective support in the area of nuclear energy and radiation 
protection from the Agency. It was deeply grateful for that support and hoped it would 
continue in the future. Despite its lack of resources, Jordan was working hard to achieve 
higher standards in various branches of scientific knowledge and in health and other social 
services. It was firmly convinced of the AgencyÂs importance not only because of the 
technical support it provided to Jordan and other developing countries but also because of its 
international role in promoting the safe use of radiation sources, the safe disposal of 
radioactive waste, the development of national regulatory bodies and capacities, the 
strengthening of safeguards and the combating of illicit trafficking in nuclear materials and 
radiation sources. 
78. To enhance the AgencyÂs role in those areas, steps should be taken, inter alia, to expand 
the technical co-operation programme, which should be financed from the Regular Budget so 
that it no longer depended on voluntary contributions and donations. To ensure the success of 
the safeguards system, it should be applied comprehensively to all parties in all geographical 
regions. That need was particularly urgent in the Middle East: IsraelÂs delay in acceding to 
the NPT and its refusal to place its nuclear facilities under Agency safeguards thwarted 
international efforts in that area. Jordan therefore urged the Conference to call on Israel to 
accede to the NPT and to place all its nuclear facilities under international supervision as the 
Arab States had done. 
79. In conclusion, he announced that Jordan would be paying its pledges to the TCF for 
2001 in full as had been its practice in previous years. 
80. Mr. SANTER (Luxembourg) said that his country welcomed the unanimous 
adoption of the final document of the 2000 NPT Review Conference as a great success for the 
entire international community. The Review Conference had not only confirmed the IAEA's 
role as guarantor of nuclear non-proliferation but had also acknowledged the importance of 
additional protocols to safeguards agreements, pointing out that aside from the general 
benefits for international peace and security that would result from a strengthened safeguards 
system, the signature by more States of additional protocols would facilitate the exchange of 
nuclear materials and would thus also be in the interests of those countries which sometimes 
criticized the nuclear supplier States for not always responding positively to requests for the 



provision of nuclear installations and material. He accordingly appealed to States which had 
not yet done so to undertake the necessary procedures for concluding such additional 
protocols and supported the Director General's desire to finalize the integrated safeguards 
system in 2001. 
81. The first review meeting under the Convention on Nuclear Safety had had a positive 
impact on the safety of nuclear power plants, but in some cases additional safety measures 
had still to be carried out. He hoped that would be done before the second review meeting 
in 2002. 
82. Luxembourg hoped that the Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management 
and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management would come into effect before the end 
of 2000 so that the first review meeting could be held within the scheduled time frame. 
83. The Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material clearly had a very 
limited scope, since it covered only the international transport of nuclear material, not the 
storage, use and domestic transport thereof. Luxembourg believed there was a need to revise 
and extend its scope in the interests of preventing illicit trafficking. Although, for reasons of 
confidentiality, a system of periodic meetings to review national reports by the Contracting 
Parties could not be envisaged under such a revised Convention, is should be possible to 
replace it by some other suitable mechanism. 
84. Finally, he noted that Luxembourg was conscious of the importance of technical 
co-operation for developing countries, especially in the fields of safety, health, agriculture 
and water resources, and therefore would contribute its full share to the TCF. 
85. Mr. MATTUG (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya) said that his country attached the utmost 
importance to technical co-operation in promoting peaceful uses of nuclear energy, which 
yielded immediate economic and social benefits to developing countries through the 
enhancement of their scientific and technological capabilities, and was deeply grateful to the 
Agency for its valuable co-operation in recent years. However, he urged it to devote a greater 
proportion of its financial resources to the technical co-operation programme and to 
encourage the transfer of nuclear technology among Member States for use in the fields of 
food and agriculture, human health, industry and water resource management, in accordance 
with General Conference resolution GC(43)/RES/14. Greater emphasis should also be placed 
on the principle of assisting the developing countries to obtain materials and equipment from 
the industrialized countries. 
86. The safeguards system should be applied to all States without exception and the 
nuclear-weapon States should draw up programmes for the elimination of their nuclear 
arsenals and the termination of all weapons development programmes. Otherwise, the 
safeguards system would appear as an instrument that served the interests of the nuclear 
Powers, enabling them to oppress other peoples by using their weapons as a deterrent. 
87. He appreciated the AgencyÂs work in the areas of radiation protection, safe transport 
and disposal of radioactive waste and materials, and the combating of illicit trafficking in 



nuclear materials. In that connection, he announced that the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya had 
decided to accede to the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material. 
88. His country attached great importance to the use of nuclear energy as a clean and 
economical means of seawater desalination. Water shortages were threatening human life all 
over the world and wars would be fought in the future for access to water unless vigorous 
action was taken to increase supplies of potable water. The Agency could contribute to that 
endeavour by promoting the use of nuclear technology for seawater desalination. The Libyan 
Arab Jamahiriya, which had been one of the sponsors of General Conference resolution 
GC(XXXIII)/RES/515 on the plan for the production of low-cost potable water, would 
continue to provide material and moral support for such projects. 
89. Attention should be given to the potential of small and medium-sized nuclear reactors 
for the production of electricity to meet the power requirements of small countries as well as 
for seawater desalination. 
90. The Libyan Arab Jamahiriya regularly attended international conferences and meetings 
at which the need for the nuclear Powers to liquidate their nuclear arsenals within a fixed time 
frame and in accordance with an internationally agreed programme was discussed. There was 
still a dangerous security imbalance in the Middle East region because Israel alone possessed 
nuclear weapons and refused to place its nuclear facilities under international supervision. 
Moreover, States outside the region were exerting pressure on some Middle Eastern States 
even though they were parties to the NPT and some had signed the Pelindaba African 
Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone Treaty and the additional protocol. That was a clear example of 
the application of double standards. Peace in the region would remain unattainable so long as 
certain Powers continued to provide excuses for IsraelÂs failure to respond to appeals for 
peace. The General Conference should therefore give priority to the implementation of 
relevant international resolutions so that a nuclear-weapon-free zone could be established in 
the Middle East. 
91. Mr. BORG (Malta), after welcoming the new Member States and associating 
himself with the statement made on behalf of the European Union, said that the increased use 
of nuclear technology for purposes other than energy production and the need to combat the 
ever-growing illicit trade in radioactive substances had made it appropriate for even small, 
non-nuclear States like Malta to join the Agency. Malta had done so in 1997. It was planning 
the enactment of legislation to establish a central authority for the control of activities 
connected with radioactive substances and the Agency's assistance would probably be sought 
for that purpose. Pending the elaboration of domestic regulations, Maltese officials were 
currently guided by British standards in all activities undertaken in connection with nuclear 
materials. Radioactive substances were used in Malta primarily in the medical field. 
92. Action had already begun on upgrading to the highest international standards Malta's 
activities relating to radioactive substances. Equipment for the detection of radioactive 
substances in merchandise containers entering Malta had been obtained with the assistance of 
the United States of America and a course of training in its use had been held in Malta in 



November 1999. About a third of the thirty participants had been from Mediterranean 
countries other than Malta. 
93. The administrative procedures necessary for the ratification of the NPT and the CTBT 
had also already started. 
94. There had been much co-operation between the Agency and Malta in the short period 
for which Malta had been a member. Two Agency experts had visited the country in 1998 for 
talks on the development of a policy for the handling of radioactive substances. Some of their 
proposals had already been put into effect. Maltese personnel whose work involved the 
handling of nuclear materials had attended courses under IAEA sponsorship. Projects were 
being carried out in civil protection and veterinary and medical services with the co-operation 
of the Agency. 
95. The Government of Malta looked forward to continued co-operation with the Agency in 
the interests of nuclear safety and was confident that, with the IAEAÂs support, the country 
would very soon be in a position to satisfy the European Union's criteria in areas relating to 
the use of radioactive substances, thus bringing its membership of that community closer to 
reality. 


The meeting was suspended at 12.10 p.m. and resumed at 12.20 p.m. 

96. Mr. MALESKI (The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia) said he wished to 
convey his country's unwavering support for the Agency in its work as a catalyst for the 
development of nuclear technology, a recognized authority on nuclear safety and an 
instrument for the verification of nuclear non-proliferation. He welcomed the Director 
General's Âone houseÂ concept for the management of the Agency and was convinced that it 
would lead to better alignment of programmes, a more streamlined Secretariat and a more 
effective outreach policy. 
97. On 11 September 1999, the Board of Governors had authorized the Director General to 
conclude a safeguards agreement and additional protocol with The Former Yugoslav Republic 
of Macedonia. Overall co-operation with the Agency was very satisfactory: thanks to the 
Agency, his country had been able to develop safety standards in conformity with 
international recommendations and to upgrade its safety infrastructure. New national 
legislation on radiation protection had been drafted and preparations for its promulgation and 
the establishment of a national regulatory body were well under way. 
98. The country programme consisted of projects in the fields of nuclear medicine, animal 
production, water for irrigation and NDT techniques in industry. His country also benefited 
from regional technical co-operation projects and was grateful to the Agency for having 
approved the Prespa Lake study, which was being implemented jointly with Albania and 
Greece. He thanked the Agency for training Macedonian experts through scientific visits and 
fellowships for courses and seminars. His country was also willing to host specialists from 
neighbouring States, an activity for which support from the Department of Technical 
Co-operation would be especially appreciated. 



99. He encouraged the Agency to persevere in its mission of furthering the use of nuclear 
energy for mutual benefit and enhanced co-operation and reaffirmed his country's willingness 
to remain a reliable member in facing the challenges of the new millennium. 
100. Mr. CUTOIU (Romania) having associated himself with the statement made on 
behalf of the European Union, recalled that the latest NPT Review Conference had reaffirmed 
the importance of the safeguards activities carried out by the Agency and its fundamental role 
in promoting nuclear non-proliferation worldwide. On 7 July 2000, Romania had notified the 
IAEA that Parliament had ratified the additional protocol to its safeguards agreement. 
Preparations to produce the reports and information required under Article 3 of the protocol 
were under way. Romania was a new beneficiary of the co-ordinated technical support 
programme for newly independent States and would, he was confident, be able to perform an 
efficient self-assessment of its system of accounting for and control of nuclear materials, 
thereby facilitating the implementation of the additional protocol. 
101. Specific activities had been conducted in co-operation with the police forces of other 
European countries to prevent and combat illicit trafficking in nuclear and radioactive 
materials. The Agency was providing assistance in training Romanian specialists, and he 
hoped that co-operation in that area would continue with the same good results. 
102. The excellent record achieved in the operation of Unit 1 of the Cernavoda nuclear 
power plant confirmed that nuclear power represented a viable alternative for the production 
of electricity in Romania. The unit assured about 10% of overall national electricity 
production, thus avoiding the release into the environment of flying ashes and greenhouse 
gases that contributed to acid rain and global warming. The new market economy, with its 
emphasis on deregulation and competition, encouraged the further development of nuclear 
power in Romania. Unit 2 of the Cernavoda plant was scheduled to be completed by 2005. 
103. At the request of the Romanian regulatory body, the Agency had recently performed an 
operational safety experience feedback (OSEF) review mission whose recommendations and 
findings were being incorporated into RomaniaÂs OSEF process with a view to ensuring safer 
operation of the Cernavoda plant. 
104. Romania had ratified the Protocol to Amend the Vienna Convention on Civil Liability 
for Nuclear Damage and the Convention on Supplementary Compensation for Nuclear 
Damage. A national draft law on civil liability which closely followed those international 
instruments was under consideration by the Romanian Parliament. Internal procedures for the 
acceptance of the amendment of Articles VI and XIV.A of the Agency's Statute were at an 
advanced stage and he expected Parliament to approve the amendments by the end of the 
year. 
105. Following the restructuring of the Romanian regulatory body, higher priority was now 
being given to safeguards and physical protection, radioactive waste management and public 
awareness. The National Commission for Nuclear Activities Control was updating its nuclear 
regulatory framework. Fundamental norms on radiological safety which reflected the 



relevant European Union directive and took into account the Agency's latest 
recommendations had recently entered into force. 
106. In recent years, within the framework of the Agency's technical co-operation 
programme, fellows and experts from several developing countries had been trained in 
Romania. His country was ready to continue such training and to contribute substantially to 
the regional technical co-operation programme for Europe. In conclusion, he thanked the 
Agency for its assistance in organizing a national public information symposium on peaceful 
uses of nuclear energy whose agenda had included topics related to radioactive waste 
management and site restoration in the uranium industry.

GENERAL DEBATE AND ANNUAL REPORT FOR 1999 (continued) 

(GC(44)/4) 

1. Mr. PAIS (Portugal) after welcoming Azerbaijan, Tajikistan and the Central 
African Republic as new members of the Agency, said that the recent NPT Review 
Conference had been an important event which had highlighted the efforts to achieve nuclear 
disarmament, the strengthening of the verification regime and the peaceful uses of nuclear 
energy. Portugal fully endorsed the view that the Agency was the sole authority competent to 
verify the compliance of Member States with their commitments under Article III of the NPT. 
2. Despite some unfair assessments of past events, the implementation of the safeguards 
system was recognized as a success that had benefited all. To enhance the benefits, however, 
the system must be strengthened to remove the gaps that had motivated criticism. The 
number of countries signing additional protocols must be increased from the present low rate 
of nine a year. He appealed to Member States which had not yet done so to sign an additional 
protocol. Portugal, for its part, expected to complete the process of concluding its own 
additional protocol before the end of 2000. 
3. Safeguards were an activity for which all States shared responsibility. A draft 
resolution to facilitate the more equitable sharing of the cost of that activity had been 
recommended by the Board of Governors for adoption by the Conference. 
4. Portugal welcomed the ongoing efforts to draft a fissile material cut-off treaty; prompt 
adherence by Member States would avert the resolution of disputes by means other than 
dialogue. The increase in the amount of fissile material of military origin placed under 
Agency safeguards was an important development and it was to be hoped that in future all 
such material would be covered by safeguards. 
5. Because of past nuclear accidents, the world had been paying increasing attention to 
co-operation in nuclear, radiation and radioactive-waste safety. Despite the Agency's efforts 
over the years to develop an effective worldwide safety regime and the adoption of its safety 
standards, which provided essential guidance for national authorities, the international 
community still had much more to do. Research reactors, illicit trafficking in nuclear and 
radioactive materials and radiation protection should be kept under review. Portugal 
endorsed the approach of countries like Ukraine, which had decided to shut down reactors 
whose standards of safety were doubtful. The legal framework for nuclear safety developed 
by the Agency provided a basis for the practices of States, although challenges still existed. 
6. Portugal acknowledged with gratitude the technical co-operation from which it had 
benefited. Unfortunately, the gap between individual targets and contributions was still high, 
and it was to be hoped that the draft resolution on the financing of technical co-operation 
would meet the expectations of all Member States. 
7. The quality of the work done by the Agency was the best guarantee of support from 
Member States in facing the challenges that lay ahead. 



8. Mr. BULBULA (Ethiopia) noted that the recent Millennium Summit had reached 
consensus on the need to eradicate the scourge of poverty. Nuclear science and technology 
could make a significant contribution to that end. Ethiopia's nuclear-technology-based 
programmes were directed towards the economic sectors that demanded the highest priority. 
In its region of Africa, national economies were primarily based on agriculture. Livestock 
was extremely important, not only as a source of milk, meat and other products but also as a 
major power source in the form of traction. 
9. The potential for livestock development was immense, but it was adversely affected by 
diseases, in the forefront of which was trypanosomiasis. The disease was transmitted by 
tsetse flies, which infested an area of over 10 million square kilometres in 36 African 
countries. It threatened some 44 million cattle and other livestock, as well as 55 million 
people who were in danger of contracting human sleeping sickness. In the infested areas, 
fertile lands could not be utilized to their full potential, and that created severe pressure on the 
limited land areas outside the tsetse-fly belt, particularly the highlands where the vast 
majority of people and livestock were concentrated and which had become increasingly less 
productive. If the obstacles created by tsetse-fly infestation were removed, people from the 
highlands would be more likely to move to the fertile lowlands. 
10. Trypanosomiasis control measures dated back 100 years in Africa and had focused on 
administering drugs. Other measures had ranged from attempts to eliminate the tsetse fly's 
habitat and exterminate wild game to blanket application of insecticide and traps. Some of 
those measures had had grave environmental consequences without achieving tsetse-fly 
eradication even in small land areas. 
11. The sterile insect technique (SIT) had been successfully employed elsewhere to 
eradicate Mediterranean fruit flies and screwworms and had more recently been used to 
eradicate tsetse flies from Zanzibar. For Ethiopia, existing control measures required constant 
and expensive imports of drugs and insecticides which had tried the patience of Government, 
farmers and donors alike. As an alternative measure, the Government had committed itself to 
building national capacity for the application of SIT technology. Given that the tsetse-fly 
problem affected countries throughout Africa, a continent-wide approach was only logical, 
and a good beginning had been made with the establishment of a pan-African SIT Forum. 
The SIT technology might also be made to work in malaria control. Ethiopia was indebted to 
the IAEA for its effective co-operation in the use of SIT technology. 
12. After the SIT project, Ethiopia attached the second-highest priority to isotope 
hydrology, a scientific and technical tool that had been used for the past six years as a 
complement to conventional techniques for studying surface and groundwater resources. 
Isotope techniques were being applied near Addis Ababa to analyse a major groundwater field 
that was to contribute about 35% of the city's water supply and to determine its susceptibility 
to environmental pollution. The work had attracted the attention of the United Nations Centre 
for Human Settlements (Habitat) and of the French Government, which was participating 
through bilateral co-operation. Isotope techniques were also being used to manage a 
geothermal power plant developed with the assistance of UNDP and the European Union, and 



had helped to explain a rise in the water level of Lake Beseka that had threatened to submerge 
a rail link to the port of Djibouti. 
13. Having seen the effectiveness of isotope hydrology in water resources development, his 
Government was initiating a programme in co-operation with the IAEA aimed at mapping 
and assessing groundwater resources throughout the country. The multi-year programme was 
expected to attract funding from other countries, particularly the United States of America, 
which would be sending senior scientists to conduct a national workshop. The programme 
had important implications for the optimal utilization of water resources, poverty alleviation 
and development in Ethiopia. 
14. Technical co-operation was well in place in various fields, including human health, 
agriculture, radiation protection and instrumentation. The Agency's support in human 
resources development, infrastructure building and technical management had been extremely 
valuable. Ethiopia had been involved in various AFRA projects which had provided 
opportunities for the sharing of experiences, expertise and resources on a regional basis. 
15. His country shared the Agency's aims and goals and would continue to co-operate with 
it in every way, including through the technical co-operation programme. He expressed 
gratitude to the Agency Departments that had contributed to the realization of Ethiopia's 
objectives. 
16. Mr. MCHUMO (United Republic of Tanzania) thanked the Agency for the 
technical assistance it had provided to his country in nuclear medicine and radiotherapy, 
which was having a positive impact on the population's living standards. Tangible results 
included the establishment of a viable radiation protection infrastructure, the eradication of 
the tsetse fly and trypanosomiasis on Zanzibar using the SIT, the introduction of nuclear 
medicine and the consolidation of radiotherapy. The economic gains being made on Zanzibar 
had generated hope and interest, not only in his own country but throughout sub-Saharan 
Africa and the world. The United Republic of Tanzania would be playing a leading role in 
the OAU's Africa-wide efforts to achieve tsetse-fly eradication using SIT, being itself 
involved in a continuing fight to reclaim its tsetse-fly-infested land for food and animal 
production and social development. He renewed TanzaniaÂs call to SIT experts to continue to 
investigate how to make the technique more cost-effective and more widely applicable. 
17. His country urgently needed the Agency's further assistance in acquiring and adapting 
nuclear techniques to fuel its socio-economic development in order to eradicate poverty. The 
delivery mechanisms for such techniques should also be improved. In particular, some of the 
fundamental procedures governing the provision of technical assistance, especially those 
relating to the least developed countries, should be reviewed to ensure sustainability and 
success. Arrangements should also be made to enable the LDCs to participate beneficially in 
regional co-operation ventures under AFRA, ARCAL or RCA. 
18. Although the Annual Report for 1999 showed an increase in contributions to the TCF 
from Member States, it likewise indicted that some pledged amounts had been received only 



in the final month of the year. The unpredictability of the amount and timing of contributions 
made project planning very difficult and effective implementation almost impossible. His 
country, for its part, would honour its pledges to the TCF for 2001. 
19. Although his country subscribed to the goal of controlling both horizontal and vertical 
proliferation, it felt that in extending the NPT indefinitely, the NPT Review and Extension 
Conference had merely endorsed the monopoly of the few nuclear-weapon States to own, 
develop and by implication use stockpiles of nuclear weapons. Those StatesÂ reluctance to 
abandon nuclear weapons had also been seen clearly in the prevarication over the conclusion 
of a universal and effectively verifiable CTBT. That situation tormented the non-nuclear-
weapon States and, if fuelled by regional conflict, could serve as an incentive to nuclear-
weapon proliferation. 
20. Nuclear technology had a pivotal role to play in economic and social development, and 
all States must be helped to benefit fully from its valuable applications. His Government 
renewed its appeal for an increase in scientific training, research, infrastructure and education, 
all of which were prerequisites for the cost-effective use of nuclear technology. In the hope 
of achieving those aims, the United Republic of Tanzania would continue to support the 
Agency in promoting the peaceful applications of nuclear technology. 
21. Mr. HALPHEN PÃREZ (Panama), summarizing the various activities being 
carried out in his country by the Department of Technical Co-operation, said that a pilot plan 
had been established for all of Central America, relating to the use of nuclear medicine for 
cancer diagnosis and he was pleased to report that the desired results had been achieved. 
Effective support had been provided in the eradication of the Mediterranean fruit fly, which 
had been jeopardizing the country's production of grain and other crops. Programmes had 
been carried out in food irradiation and mutation breeding with a view to preservation and 
improved yields. Effective steps had also been taken to curb the screwworm scourge which 
had been afflicting his country's cattle. 
22. Thanks to the efforts of the President and the authorities concerned, Panama had 
managed to eliminate its arrears in the payment of its contributions and as a result its voting 
rights had been restored. 
23. Small in size but of crucial importance in terms of its geographical location, Panama 
had cut itself wide open to create the waterway known as the Panama Canal. That marvel of 
engineering linked two oceans, obviating the need to circumnavigate all of South America 
and, thus benefiting international maritime commerce. Under the terms of the Panama Canal 
Treaty of 1977, the Canal Zone had been returned to PanamaÂs jurisdiction on 
31 December 1999 and the country's territorial integrity had been restored with the 
withdrawal of the United States military. Panama was currently taking advantage of the 
Agency's expertise in the safe transport of nuclear material in seeking to protect itself and the 
entire region against the consequences of any accident that might occur during the transport 
of nuclear materials or radioactive waste through the Canal by duly authorized vessels. 



24. In conclusion, he said that Panama endorsed the Agency's efforts to foster international 
peace and security and warmly welcomed the new members.

REPORT OF THE SCIENTIFIC FORUM 

1. The PRESIDENT invited the Rapporteur, Mr. Williams, to present the report of 
the Scientific Forum. 
2. Mr. Williams presented the report which is reproduced in the Annex. 
3. The PRESIDENT thanked Mr. Williams for his most interesting report and the 
Secretariat for their excellent preparation of the Scientific Forum. 
4. Mr. BALU (India) commended the Director General for continuing to hold the 
Scientific Forum alongside the General Conference. Such events restored the scientific 
character of the Agency and were reminiscent of former years when scientific gatherings had 
been a regular event. The theme of the forum had been both timely and topical. If prompt 
action was not taken to turn existing radioactive waste management options, including 
innovative fuel cycle concepts, into real solutions, the situation could only become more 
difficult as time progressed. Technological solutions were available, particularly in closed 
fuel cycles. 


IMPLEMENTATION OF UNITED NATIONS SECURITY COUNCIL RESOLUTIONS 
RELATING TO IRAQ 

(GC(44)/11, GC(44)/L.2 and Add.1) 

5. Ms. QUINCY (France), speaking on behalf of the European Union and the 
additional co-sponsors listed in Addendum 1 to document GC(44)/L.2, said that the draft 
resolution contained in the latter document took note of developments over the past year and 
called upon Iraq to implement all relevant Security Council resolutions and to co-operate 
fully with the Agency. 
6. Mr. AL-JANABI (Iraq) objected strongly to the inclusion of item 21 on the 
agenda of the General Conference. Iraq had discharged all its obligations under paragraphs 
12 and 13 of Security Council resolution 687. Paragraph 31 of document GOV/INF/1999/4 
stated that the AgencyÂs extensive verification activities had revealed no indication that Iraq 
possessed nuclear weapons or any meaningful amounts of weapon-usable material, or that it 
had retained any practical capability for the production of such material. Moreover, in a letter 
to the Security Council dated 10 April 2000, the Agency had confirmed that Iraq had afforded 
the necessary co-operation to a team of its inspectors that had visited Iraq from 
22-25 January 2000. 
7. It was important that the Agency did not allow the issue to become politicized, and that 
the implementation of Security Council resolutions was not confused with IraqÂs 
implementation of its obligations under its safeguards agreement which it respected. The 
Agency should therefore make an honest report of its findings to the Security Council and 
close the nuclear file on Iraq, a step it would have taken in 1998 had it not been placed under 
pressure by the United States whose motive was to prolong the embargo that had been 
responsible for the deaths of 1.5 million Iraqi citizens. 



8. Iraq had very good reasons for declining to accept Security Council resolution 1284. 
That resolution was in essence a re-formulation of Security Council Resolution 687 aimed at 
prolonging the blockade. It ran contrary to resolutions passed by the General Assembly and 
the Security Council, and to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. It had also not been 
approved by three permanent members of the Security Council: China, France and the 
Russian Federation. 
9. The draft resolution which had been submitted by the European Union totally 
disregarded the AgencyÂs findings in Iraq over the past ten years and its reports on those 
findings. It was political in intent and, if approved, would turn the Agency into a tool for 
perpetuating the campaign which was being waged by the United States and the United 
Kingdom against Iraq. He called upon the General Conference to reject it and to condemn the 
acts of aggression which had been perpetrated against his country. 
10. Mr. RITCH (United States of America) said he strongly supported the draft 
resolution, in particular its emphasis on the need for the Agency to ascertain whether there 
had been any developments in IraqÂs nuclear activities since 1998. That was a prerequisite 
for the implementation of a strong and credible system of ongoing monitoring and 
verification, as required by the relevant Security Council resolutions. Iraq had to comply with 
its obligations under those resolutions in the interests of international peace and security. 
11. Ms. AL-MULLA (Kuwait) said she did not wish to be drawn into a political 
debate, which would be inappropriate at the AgencyÂs General Conference. Although she had 
the greatest respect for the people and civilization of Iraq, that country was obliged to comply 
with its obligations under the relevant Security Council resolutions. The fact that some 
members of the Security Council had had misgivings about certain resolutions was not a valid 
argument. All Security Council resolutions were mandatory. She appealed to the greater 
wisdom of the Iraqi authorities and urged them to face up to the current situation, for which 
they were largely to blame, and to take heed of the draft resolution under consideration which 
was based on reports submitted to the General Conference and was in line with the relevant 
Security Council resolutions. 
12. Mr. AL-JANABI (Iraq) said that the United States had no right to speak of the 
need to comply with Security Council resolutions in the interests of international peace and 
security when, for almost ten years, it had threatened peace and security in the Middle East 
through its continuing acts of aggression against Iraq. By failing to respect the sovereignty, 
territorial integrity and political independence of Iraq, inter alia through air strikes, the United 
States and its ally, the United Kingdom, had flagrantly violated international law, the Charter 
of the United Nations and relevant Security Council resolutions. 
13. Responding to the remarks of the representative of Kuwait, he said that it was 
impossible to avoid politicizing what was already a political issue. Iraq viewed the current 
situation in the light of international law and not, like Kuwait, in the context of an alliance 
with the United States, the United Kingdom and other countries to which it provided the 
logistical and financial support they needed to conduct a campaign of aggression against his 
country. Moreover, hypocritical statements about the regrettable situation of IraqÂs civilian 



population were not convincing. The only governments currently threatening peace and 
security in the Middle East were those perpetrating or supporting the continuing unlawful acts 
of violence against Iraq. 
14. Mr. RYZHOV (Russian Federation) said that his country looked forward to the 
swift completion of the AgencyÂs work pursuant to the United Nations Security Council 
resolutions relating to IraqÂs nuclear activities. Over the years the Agency had succeeded in 
establishing a technically coherent picture of IraqÂs nuclear programme and the remaining 
uncertainties could be resolved through the OMV plan, which was vital to the implementation 
of Security Council resolution 1284. Pending implementation of that resolution, it was 
important not to lose momentum. In January 2000, Agency inspectors had verified IraqÂs 
declared nuclear material, confirming that it had fully complied with its obligations under its 
safeguards agreement. It was also essential that the new monitoring commission, 
UNMOVIC, was fully accountable to the Security Council, and that there should be no 
possibility of its being used to prolong sanctions unnecessarily, which might cause it to suffer 
the fate of its compromised predecessor. 
15. The content of the draft resolution which had been submitted was not entirely clear. It 
could convey a more positive message than it did, and reversing the order of preambular 
paragraphs (d) and (e) might help achieve that goal. Moreover, the latter part of preambular 
paragraph (e), from the words Ânoting, howeverÂ, cast a shadow on the positive developments 
highlighted in the first part of that paragraph and it should perhaps be deleted. Operative 
paragraph 4 could be interpreted as meaning that the Agency should start its verification 
activities in Iraq from scratch again, which was clearly not in keeping with the Director 
GeneralÂs statement on the subject and the relevant decisions of the NPT Review Conference. 
He also had serious doubts about paragraph 6, which welcomed the reconstitution of the joint 
import/export mechanism. The latter already went beyond the guidelines for the export of 
nuclear material agreed upon by Member States and would impose additional and unjustified 
obligations on Iraq. 
16. The PRESIDENT took it that the General Conference wished to adopt the draft 
resolution contained in document GC(44)/L.2 without a vote. 
17. Mr. AL-JANABI (Iraq) said that the representative of the Russian Federation had 
proposed amendments which warranted discussion. 
18. The PRESIDENT said it was his understanding that the Russian Federation had 
been merely commenting on the draft resolution and that no formal proposals had been made. 
19. Mr. AL-JANABI (Iraq) requested that the draft resolution be put to a roll-call 
vote. 
20. The United Kingdom, having been drawn by lot by the President, was called upon to 
vote first. 



21. The result of the vote was as follows: 
In favour: Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Canada, 
Colombia, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, 
Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, 
Israel, Italy, Japan, Jordan, Republic of Korea, Kuwait, Latvia, 
Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Mexico, Monaco, Namibia, 
Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Peru, Poland, Portugal, 
Romania, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, 
Sri Lanka, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, Turkey, Ukraine, 
United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom, United States of 
America, Uruguay, Venezuela. 

 

Abstaining: Algeria, Angola, Bangladesh, Belarus, Benin, Burkina Faso, 
China, Cuba, Egypt, Ethiopia, Ghana, India, Indonesia, Islamic 
Republic of Iran, Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, Malaysia, Morocco, 
Myanmar, Nigeria, Pakistan, Philippines, Russian Federation, 
Sudan, Tunisia, United Republic of Tanzania, Uzbekistan, 
Viet Nam. 

 


22. The draft resolution was adopted by fifty-four votes to zero, with twenty-seven 
abstentions. 
23. Mr. ZHANG Yishan (China) said that the standards governing international 
relations and the authority of the Security Council clearly had to be respected. However, so 
did the sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence of Iraq. The sanctions against that 
country had been in place for ten years and had caused acute suffering to its people, and there 
had been indiscriminate bombardments. He appealed for an end to the military action and 
urged that the progress achieved by Iraq be assessed in an objective light. China had 
abstained from voting on the resolution. 
24. Mr. QASHUT (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya) said that his delegation had also 
abstained from voting. He drew attention to the fact that various paragraphs of Security 
Council resolution 1284 called on the international community to suspend sanctions in order 
to guarantee the rights of the Iraqi people to proper health care and nutrition. Those 
provisions had to be respected too. 
25. Mr. AL-JANABI (Iraq) thanked all those who had not voted in favour of the 
resolution. Resolutions such as the one just adopted had been used before as a pretext for 
continuing the blockade on his country without justification. On the other hand, other 
General Conference resolutions had noted that Iraq had complied with international 
requirements in all except very minor respects. In fact, Iraq had been complying with its 
obligations for seven years, a detail not mentioned in the resolution. 
26. Mr. SHOUKRY (Egypt) said that the fact that Iraq had complied with Security 
Council resolutions was significant. The resolution just adopted was a moderate one 



compared with those of previous years. It was time for the General Conference to move 
towards consensus on the issue so that the suffering of the Iraqi people could be brought to an 
end. 


IMPLEMENTATION OF THE AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE AGENCY AND THE 
DEMOCRATIC PEOPLEÂS REPUBLIC OF KOREA FOR THE APPLICATION OF 
SAFEGUARDS IN CONNECTION WITH THE TREATY ON THE 
NON-PROLIFERATION OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS 

(GC(44)/16, GC(44)/L.12/Rev.1 and Add.1) 

27. Mr. MORGAN (Canada), introducing the draft resolution contained in document 
GC(44)/L.12/Rev.1, said that the large number of co-sponsors reflected the level of concern 
over the fact that the Agency had still not been able to verify the accuracy and completeness 
of the DPRKÂs initial declaration under its safeguards agreement, even though that country 
remained a party to the NPT. The resolution urged the DPRK to comply fully with its 
safeguards agreement. 
28. Despite the recent positive developments in north-east Asia, the fundamental problem 
remained, and those positive developments would only bear fruit if the co-operation sought 
was forthcoming. 
29. Mr. ZHANG Yishan (China) said that the maintenance of peace and security on 
the Korean Peninsula was in the interests of all peoples of the world. Discussion of the issue 
did not always take into account the historical background to the problem, and patience and 
continuous effort were needed to arrive at a solution. Since the North-South summit meeting 
of the DPRK and the Republic of Korea dialogue between the two countries had increased, 
and good progress had been made in negotiations between the DPRK and the Agency on 
technical issues. Those positive developments should be welcomed, whereas further 
application of pressure could be counter-productive. 
30. Mr. RITCH (United States of America) welcomed the progress made at the 
inter-Korean summit, which he hoped would offer the prospect of lasting peace and stability 
on the Korean Peninsula. He also welcomed the reinstatement of the normalization talks 
between Japan and the DPRK. The opening up of relations between the DPRK and such 
countries as Australia, Canada, Italy and the Philippines could help pave the way for 
improved relations between the DPRK and the United States. The Agreed Framework would 
remain an essential element of that process. Since construction of the light-water reactor had 
already begun, it was important that the DPRK take all steps deemed necessary by the 
Agency with regard to monitoring and the verification of its initial declarations to the 
Agency, and he called on it to show renewed co-operation and flexibility with a view to 
fulfilling its non-proliferation commitments. 
31. Mr. RYZHOV (Russian Federation) said that the General Conference had been 
discussing the implementation of safeguards in the DPRK for many years. Unfortunately, it 
was difficult to know how far the resolution in question would solve the problem. Though all 
seemed to agree that the DPRK should comply fully and immediately with its obligations 



under its safeguards agreement, the Agreed Framework stated that the DPRK would have to 
come into full compliance with that agreement only when a significant portion of the LWR 
project was complete, but before the delivery of key nuclear components. That contradiction 
was a significant impediment to the solution of the issue, and every effort should be made to 
resolve the conflict so that the matter could be finally dispatched. 
32. Mr. Sang-duk CHOI (Republic of Korea) said that, for a number of years, the 
General Conference had adopted resolutions expressing concern at the continued 
non-compliance by the DPRK with its safeguards agreement. Despite strenuous efforts by the 
Agency, no significant progress had been made. The DPRKÂs failure to fulfil its obligations 
constituted a major challenge not only to the AgencyÂs safeguards system, but also to the 
basic framework of the global nuclear non-proliferation regime. Adopting the draft resolution 
was the least the General Conference could do to meet the responsibilities placed upon it by 
the Statute. 
33. Nevertheless, while a firm stand had to be taken against any challenge to the global 
non-proliferation regime, it was important to recognize the new developments that had taken 
place on the Korean Peninsula. The North-South summit earlier in the year had been a 
turning point for both inter-Korean relations and global peace and stability. 
34. Mr. NAGANUMA (Japan) said that, while he welcomed the recent positive 
political developments, he felt obliged to point out that no progress had as yet been made with 
regard to the implementation of the DPRKÂs safeguards agreement. He hoped that the 
resolution adopted at the next session of the General Conference would reflect a more 
positive situation. 
35. The PRESIDENT took it that the General Conference wished to adopt the draft 
resolution contained in document GC(44)/L.12/Rev.1. 
36. It was so decided. 


The meeting rose at 1:05 p.m. 

 


Report to the forty-fourth General Conference of the IAEA 

from the third Scientific Forum 

Radioactive Waste Management: Turning Options into Solutions 

 

 

1. The development of a publicly acceptable solution to the management of radioactive 
waste is an issue which is central not only to the future of nuclear energy but also to dealing 
with the wastes which have arisen from past and current nuclear programmes. The Scientific 
Forum addressed this important issue from the viewpoint of what has been achieved so far, 
the current difficulties and what can be learned from experiences to date. The Forum was 
designed to build on the conclusions of the significant and successful IAEA conference held 
in Cordoba in March of this year. The Forum was well attended and the stimulating 
presentations were of high quality. 

 

2. The Scientific Forum heard that much had been done but that much more was needed to 
address what the Chair of the Forum referred to as the most perplexing topic in nuclear 
technology today. The Chair described the ÂrealitiesÂ which lay at the core of the issue as 
essentially being the physical, technological and social realities. The physical reality is 
simple, radioactive waste exists and volumes, although comparatively low, are increasing. 
The technological reality is that the technology exists to safely manage radioactive wastes 
now and in the near future but there are issues about geological disposal. The social reality is 
characterized by the gap in perception between the scientific community and the public at 
large. 

 

3. The first session set the scene on the current status of radioactive waste management in 
the world today, and discussed the strategy needed to develop a national repository for spent 
nuclear fuel. A major issue to emerge was that relating to the classification of waste, which is 
different in different countries. ÂWasteÂ was not seen as a scientific term and only a few 
countries appeared to use the IAEA defined terminology. The use of so many different 
national definitions makes it difficult to understand and compare the size and scope of the 
problem and leads to unnecessary public concerns. It is hoped that the introduction of the 
Joint Convention will provide an opportunity to achieve more consistency in the classification 
of radioactive wastes. 

 

4. It was clear from the presentations and the discussion that the management of 
radioactive waste needs to be addressed in a consistent and comprehensive way. The question 
was raised of how to handle issues relating to radioactive waste management which have 
solution times longer than terms of office of the political decision makers. The role of the 
regulatory body is important in addressing this issue as it can provide the continuity of 
oversight needed. Substantial progress has been made in reducing the waste arisings per kWh 
and there is now recognition that the best way to manage waste is to minimize arisings so as 
to reduce the disposal burden. In relation to disposal of high level waste, experience has 
shown that it is counter-productive for the scientific community to claim that they know all 
the answers and that the risks well into the future can be calculated with confidence. A more 
sustainable approach is to recognize that to gain public acceptance it is necessary to take time 


and not try to rush to premature decisions, which are likely to be negative. A carefully 
planned step by step approach, which involves the public and gives time to build trust and 
confidence, is necessary for success. This approach must be flexible to the extent that it 
recognizes that there are uncertainties and so making provisions to permit retrievability of 
waste is now seen as an essential prerequisite for progress on disposal. There is also a need to 
have a clear understanding of what is meant by retrievability. 

 

5. The second session looked at the Âtechnological reality of what is being done, with 
examples of developments in a number of countries including a country with a major nuclear 
power programme and a country with no nuclear power programme. In each case it was 
shown that with the exception of the disposal of high level and other long lived wastes, well 
planned radioactive waste management programmes are possible. The technology exists but 
it is essential to recognize that the solutions depend upon the waste type and advantage can be 
gained by classifying waste in relation to, inter alia, radioactive half-life. The session also 
discussed the use of novel technologies which could be used to design power reactors, which 
did not produce any actinide or transuranic waste and which transmuted long lived fission 
products. The technologies proposed prompted some lively discussion with the practicality of 
turning a theoretical concept into a practical design being a key concern. Nevertheless, it was 
felt that whilst further research is justified, transmutation on a practical engineering scale is 
far from certain and the prospect of transmutation should not prevent countries taking positive 
actions on waste treatment and disposal as soon as possible. 

 

6. The third session included a very comprehensive review of the key issues associated 
with radioactive waste that were discussed at the Cordoba conference. It is clear that 
indefinite surface storage of waste is not a sustainable solution and progress must be made to 
an integrated solution to radioactive waste management that includes disposal. International 
repositories could offer a means for countries with small nuclear power programmes or 
without nuclear power programmes to dispose of their high activity and long-lived waste 
without incurring the very high costs of a national repository programme. However, it was 
clearly recognized that international repositories are controversial and that the disposal of 
waste is primarily a national responsibility. The Forum heard a report on the development of 
controls on international transport of radioactive waste. The comprehensive nature of the 
report gave reassurance that the issue is being addressed and that an effective regulatory 
system is in place to ensure transport safety. A significant development has been the 
introduction of the INF (Irradiated Nuclear Fuel) requirements for the safe carriage of 
irradiated nuclear fuel, plutonium and high-level radioactive waste on board ships into the 
mandatory SOLAS (Safety of Life at Sea) convention. 

 

7. The Forum also considered the special problem of disused sealed sources that had been 
used for medical, research and industrial purposes. The issue of how to deal with sealed 
sources when they have reached the end of their useful lives was discussed. The view of the 
Forum was that spent sealed sources should be handled as part of an integrated waste 
management strategy. There is clearly an issue for countries that do not have nuclear power 
programmes and may therefore not have a radioactive waste management programme or an 
effective regulatory body. The issue of the use of boreholes to dispose of sealed sources 


prompted a lively discussion. Whilst it was recognized that boreholes provided a relatively 
simple and inexpensive solution, a borehole used for this purpose was a radioactive waste 
repository and should therefore have a comprehensive safety case to justify its use. 

 

8. The Forum heard the views of a panel of distinguished experts on the key issues relating 
to radioactive waste management, but mainly focused on disposal. The Chair posed three 
questions that were at the heart of the issue. The first asked why there was a problem with 
radioactive waste. The general consensus of the panel was that the problem existed because 
the issue was a social as well as a technical one. The second question asked who or what was 
missing from the deliberations necessary to achieve consensus. The panel generally agreed 
that the public, politicians, policy makers and the media needed to be engaged in the decision 
making process. The third question asked where we go from here. The response from the 
panel was to continue the dialogue, continue to develop and have confidence in the 
engineering and scientific proposals for effectively managing waste, recognize that resolution 
will take time and plan to provide solutions to the options that are or will be available to 
society. 

 

9. The lively panel discussion, which included participation from the floor, can be 
summarized as follows: 

 

- technological solutions to the safe management of radioactive waste exist, but 
public acceptance is needed; 

- a structured participatory process is needed for decision making; 

- consensus of all parties is unlikely and therefore a formal, transparent decision 
making process with public participation is essential; 

- the decision making process needs to be step wise with the ability to reverse 
decisions at a later stage; 

- opinion formers responsible for political decisions have not yet entered the 
debate; 

- progress has to be made on a national level particularly in relation to the siting of 
repositories; 

- it is important to have a stable legal and regulatory framework; 

- international co-operation in the development of technology and safety standards 
can supplement national programmes; and 

- clarity is needed on the application of the terms ÂretrievabilityÂ and ÂreversibilityÂ. 

 

10. The panel advised the IAEA that its role included facilitating international exchange of 
experience on technical and social issues, collaboration on creating opportunities for R&D, 
and continuing peer reviews of programmes and activities in Member States. It concluded 
that these exchanges were a supplement to, not a substitute for, national discussions and 
programmes. Given that the development of such programmes will take considerable time, it 
was felt that to hold a single global forum involving stakeholders was not appropriate at this 
time but that the IAEA could play a role in promoting active engagement between the 
scientific community and society in general. 

 


11. The Forum provided an excellent opportunity to discuss this important issue and the 
number of participants and their lively interventions showed the strength of interest in the 
topic.

EXAMINATION OF DELEGATESÂ CREDENTIALS 

(GC(44)/25) 

1. The PRESIDENT said that the General Committee had met the day before to 
examine the credentials of all delegates, as provided for in Rule 28 of the Rules of Procedure. 
The report of the Committee was contained in document GC(44)/25. After discussion, the 
Committee had recommended the adoption by the Conference of the draft resolution 
contained in paragraph 9 of its report, with the reservations and position expressed in the 
report. Since the Committee had met, he had been informed that credentials in proper form 
had been received from Greece, Mexico, Panama and the Syrian Arab Republic. 
2. He took it that the General Conference was prepared to adopt the draft resolution 
contained in document GC(44)/25. 
3. It was so decided. 
4. Mr. SALEHI (Islamic Republic of Iran) said that, though he did not wish to block 
consensus, his delegation refused to recognize the credentials issued from the occupied 
territory of Al-Quds (Jerusalem). 
5. Mr. SHOUKRY (Egypt) said that he had studied the report of the General 
Committee on delegatesÂ credentials and EgyptÂs acceptance of IsraelÂs credentials did not 
extend to the territories occupied since 1967, including Jerusalem and the Golan Heights. 
6. Mr. BAR (Israel) said that the issue of Jerusalem was not and could not be on the 
agenda of the General Conference. 


REPORT ON CONTRIBUTIONS PLEDGED TO THE TECHNICAL CO-OPERATION 
FUND FOR 2001 

(GC(44)/20/Rev.3) 

 

7. The PRESIDENT said that, by 6 p.m. on 21 September 2000, the contributions 
pledged by Member States to the Technical Co-operation Fund had amounted to 
US $7 260 560. Since then further members had communicated pledges to the Director 
General, bringing the total amount pledged to US $9 297 650, which represented 12.74% of 
the target. 
8. He urged those delegations which had not yet done so to make their 2001 pledges and to 
pay their contributions in full at the earliest opportunity, so that the Secretariat could submit 
to the Technical Assistance and Co-operation Committee a proposed 2001 programme based 
on reasonably assured resources and subsequently implement the approved programme 
without hindrance or uncertainty. 


The meeting was suspended at 3.20 p.m. and resumed at 4.15 p.m. 


APPLICATION OF IAEA SAFEGUARDS IN THE MIDDLE EAST 

(GC(44)/14 and Corr.1, GC(44)/L.1 and Add.1) 

9. Mr. SHOUKRY (Egypt) said that the main objective of the draft resolution 
contained in document GC(44)/L.1 was to strengthen confidence among countries in the 
region with a view to encouraging them to place all their nuclear installations under Agency 
safeguards and to adhere to relevant international treaties and instruments, in particular the 
NPT. The resolution was the fruit of consultations with the interested parties, and it took 
account of the latest international developments in the non-proliferation sphere and reflected 
the importance that the international community attached to the issue. Its wording was very 
similar to that adopted by the preceding session of the General Conference, with only minor 
modifications to bring it up to date. Unfortunately, despite the flexibility and co-operation 
shown by many during the drafting and amendment process, the goal of applying safeguards 
throughout the region was no nearer realization. 
10. Finally, he welcomed the Director GeneralÂs proposals on the issue and urged him to 
continue his efforts. 
11. Mr. BAHRAN (Yemen) said that his country supported the draft resolution 
because it believed in the principles of legality and equality of rights and responsibilities. On 
the preceding day, Yemen had signed a safeguards agreement with the Agency, thus 
demonstrating its belief that the application of Agency safeguards - not only in the Middle 
East but worldwide - was the best means of giving effect to the NPT. 
12. The PRESIDENT took it that the Conference was prepared to adopt the draft 
resolution contained in document GC(44)/L.1 without a vote. 
13. It was so decided. 
14. Mr. BEN SHABAN (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya) said that the ongoing state of 
insecurity in the Middle East was due to IsraelÂs continuing refusal to place its nuclear 
facilities under Agency safeguards, despite the repeated requests that had been addressed to it 
by the United Nations General Assembly and the Security Council to do so. The final 
document of the 2000 NPT Review Conference had reaffirmed the importance of IsraelÂs 
accession to the NPT and of its placing all its nuclear facilities under comprehensive IAEA 
safeguards. He called on that country to comply with those requirements and to undertake to 
destroy all its nuclear weapons, which actions were essential prerequisites to the 
establishment of an NWFZ in the region. 
15. Mr. SIAGE (Syrian Arab Republic) said that the issue in question had been on the 
ConferenceÂs agenda for many years, but no resolution of the problem had been possible 
owing to IsraelÂs stubborn refusal to accede to the NPT and place its nuclear installations 
under Agency safeguards. Moreover, the Conference seemed reluctant to state clearly that the 
fault lay with Israel. Syria believed in the possibility of lasting peace in the region based on 
international law. He hoped that the international community would apply the necessary 
pressure on Israel for it to accede to the NPT. 



16. Mr. FRANK (Israel) said Israel had joined the consensus on the resolution, 
despite its inherent deficiencies, because it recognized that an NWFZ could contribute to 
peace, security and arms control in the region. Some elements of the resolution ran counter to 
IsraelÂs policy, and his delegationÂs decision not to block the consensus on it should not be 
interpreted as an acceptance of all its provisions. IsraelÂs position had always been that the 
nuclear issue, together with all other regional security issues, could only be dealt with within 
the framework of the peace process. 
17. A regional NWFZ had to be supported by all countries in the region and could not be 
imposed on a State. All the parties to the NPT had reaffirmed their support for those 
principles since the adoption of the Principles and Objectives for Nuclear Non-Proliferation 
and Disarmament at the 1995 NPT Review Conference. In any regional security and arms 
control process, the security margins of a participating state had to correspond to its 
perception of the threat to which it was exposed and should not be diminished by that process. 
A practical step-by-step approach was the only way forward, beginning with confidence- and 
security-building measures that did not detract from the security margins of any regional 
state, followed by the establishment of peaceful relations and reconciliation. Then, in due 
course, conventional and non-conventional arms control could be addressed. Confidence 
building was a long process and it was important not to intimidate, harass or ostracize those 
that needed time to assure themselves that their basic security interests would not be 
compromised. 
18. The Government of Israel had made vigorous efforts to achieve peace in the region and 
had demonstrated its commitment to the peace process. He hoped that the future would bring 
reconciliation, security and peace in the Middle East. 
19. The PRESIDENT said that, pursuant to consultations on the issue, it had been 
agreed that he would read out the following statement: 
ÂIn the context of the agenda item on the ÂApplication of IAEA safeguards in the 
Middle EastÂ, the General Conference requests the Director General to make 
arrangements to convene a forum in which participants from the Middle East and other 
interested parties could learn from the experience of other regions, including in the area 
of confidence building relevant to the establishment of a nuclear weapon free zone. 

ÂIt calls on the Director General, with States of the Middle East and other interested 
parties, to develop an agenda and modalities which will help to ensure a successful 
forum.Â 


20. The Conference endorsed the Presidential statement. 


ISRAELI NUCLEAR CAPABILITIES AND THREAT 

(GC(44)/8) 

21. Mr. REGUIEG (Algeria), speaking on behalf of the Arab Group, said that the 
Arab countries had long demonstrated their willingness to work towards peace and security in 
the Middle East. Unfortunately, they had not met with a positive response from Israel whose 



nuclear capabilities continued to pose a threat to all other countries in the region. The latter 
had therefore tabled a draft resolution stating their concern at IsraelÂs continuing 
unwillingness to accede to the NPT and emphasizing the threat that IsraelÂs nuclear facilities 
posed to the entire region. However, following consultations, they had decided not to submit 
the resolution but rather to endorse a Presidential statement in the interest of achieving 
consensus at the Conference. 
22. The PRESIDENT said that, pursuant to consultations, it had been agreed that he 
would read out the following statement which was the result of a delicate compromise: 
ÂThe General Conference recalls the statement by the President of the 36th session 
in 1992 concerning the agenda item ÂIsraeli Nuclear Capabilities and ThreatÂ. That 
statement considered it desirable not to consider that agenda item at the 37th session. 
The General Conference also recalls the statement by the President of the 43rd session 
in 1999 concerning the same agenda item. At the 44th session, this item was, at the 
request of certain Member States, reinscribed on the agenda. The item was discussed. 
The President notes that certain Member States intend to include this item on the 
provisional agenda of the 45th regular session of the General Conference.Â 


23. The Conference endorsed the Presidential statement. 
24. Mr. BEN SHABAN (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya) said that IsraelÂs nuclear 
capabilities were a threat to the entire region. There could be no real peace in the Middle East 
as long as Israel opposed the establishment of an NWFZ and refused to sign the NPT and 
accept Agency safeguards. The Agency should intensify its efforts to resolve those problems 
and the Arab States were ready to work together with others to achieve that goal. 
Furthermore, the support certain countries gave Israel should cease, as it jeopardized 
international peace. Finally, the General Conference should adopt measures to bring Israel 
into line with the will of the international community. 
25. Mr. SIAGE (Syrian Arab Republic) said that his country was concerned over 
IsraelÂs nuclear capabilities. That country continued to supplement its nuclear arsenal with 
missiles and submarines, thereby threatening stability in neighbouring States and in countries 
thousands of miles away, yet the Presidential statement which had just been adopted made no 
mention of such concerns. His delegation was disappointed with that result and he called on 
the nuclear-weapon States to do away with double standards under the NPT. 
26. Mr. SHOUKRY (Egypt) said that nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation 
were important objectives worldwide, but they were of especially pressing importance in the 
Middle East. Egypt had been advocating an NWFZ in the Middle East since 1974 and, within 
the Agency, it had called for the implementation of comprehensive safeguards throughout the 
region. All Arab countries had adhered to the NPT and had placed their nuclear facilities 
under Agency safeguards. Israel was the only country in the region that had not done so. 
Moreover, the final document of the 2000 NPT Review Conference had reaffirmed the need 
for Israel to join the NPT and submit its facilities to safeguards. The international community 
should shoulder its responsibilities with regard to the establishment of an NWFZ in the 



Middle East and address the legitimate concerns expressed by many countries. Any nuclear 
capabilities that threatened peace and security in the Middle East had to be removed and 
nuclear applications used only to enhance the prosperity of peoples. 
27. Mr. SALEHI (Islamic Republic of Iran) endorsed the concerns which had been 
expressed by other countries regarding the dangerous situation in the Middle East caused by 
IsraelÂs refusal to join the NPT and other legally binding international instruments. 
Adherence to the NPT and implementation of safeguards could not be subject to 
preconditions. His delegation was disappointed to see that consideration of the issue had 
resulted only in a Presidential statement, and he called on the international community to 
exert pressure on Israel. 
28. Mr. FRANK (Israel) said that the famous Spanish scholar and statesman, Salvador 
de Madariaga, had written that nations did not distrust each other because they were armed; 
they were armed because they distrusted each other. To want disarmament before a minimum 
of agreement on fundamentals had been reached was as absurd as wanting people to get 
undressed in winter. 


The meeting was suspended at 5.20 p.m. and resumed at 6.30 p.m. 

ORAL REPORT BY THE CHAIRMAN OF THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE 

29. Mr. GREGORIC (Slovenia), Chairman of the Committee of the Whole, presented 
the outcome of the CommitteeÂs deliberations on agenda items 5(c), 9-19 and 24. All of the 
draft resolutions the Committee was submitting to the Plenary had been adopted in the 
Committee by consensus, with the exception of the draft resolution contained in 
document GC(44)/L.17 on item 15, Strengthening of the AgencyÂs technical co-operation 
activities, where one delegation had been unable to join the consensus. 
30. The PRESIDENT, having congratulated the Chairman on the exemplary fashion 
in which he had conducted the CommitteeÂs proceedings, invited the Conference to take up 
one by one the items considered by the Committee of the Whole. 


Restoration of voting rights (agenda item 5(c)) 

31. As recommended by the Committee of the Whole, the Conference requested the Board 
of Governors to review after November 2001 the criteria, guidelines and measures being 
applied in connection with requests for the restoration of voting rights, and to report its 
findings to the General Conference in 2002 at its forty-sixth regular session. 


The AgencyÂs accounts for 1999 (agenda item 9) 

32. As recommended by the Committee of the Whole, the draft resolution on page II of 
document GC(44)/5 was adopted. 



The AgencyÂs programme and budget for 2001 (agenda item 10) 

33. As recommended by the Committee of the Whole, draft resolutions A and C in Annex I 
to document GC(44)/6, and draft resolution B in document GC(44)/6/Mod.1 were adopted. 


The financing of technical co-operation (agenda item 11) 

34. As recommended by the Committee of the Whole, the draft resolution contained in 
document GC(44)/L.5 was adopted. 


The financing of safeguards (agenda item 12) 

35. As recommended by the Committee of the Whole, the draft resolution contained in 
document GC(44)/L.6 was adopted. 
36. Mr. HOANG VAN NHA (Viet Nam), speaking on behalf of the ASEAN member 
countries Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Viet Nam, 
commended the Chairman of the Board of Governors on having achieved a consensus on the 
issue of the financing of safeguards. However, a number of factors should have been taken 
into consideration with regard to the phasing out of shielding. Firstly, Member States had 
common but differentiated responsibilities, a point noted by the NPT Review Conference. 
Secondly, per capita GNP should not be the only basis used for establishing the categories of 
shielded Members. Other factors such as whether a State had significant nuclear programmes 
and activities, whether it was a nuclear-weapon State, and the arrangements for designated 
seats on the Board under the amended Article VI of the Statute should also be taken into 
account. Thirdly, the possibility should be available of recategorizing Member States if their 
per capita GNP fell significantly during the phase-out period. It might therefore prove 
necessary to review implementation of the new arrangements for the financing of safeguards 
at appropriate intervals in order to ensure fair treatment of shielded members. 
37. The decision to end the shielding system was a major concession on the part of the 
shielded countries and should be truly reciprocated in all the AgencyÂs areas of activity. 


Scale of assessment of MembersÂ contributions towards the Regular Budget (agenda 
item 13) 

38. As recommended by the Committee of the Whole, the draft resolution on page 3 of 
document GC(44)/18 was adopted. 


Measures to strengthen international co-operation in nuclear, radiation and waste safety 
(agenda item 14) 

39. As recommended by the Committee of the Whole, the draft resolutions contained in 
documents GC(44)/L.3, L.4, L.7, L.8, L.9 , L.10 and L.19 were adopted. 



Strengthening of the AgencyÂs technical co-operation activities (agenda item 15) 

40. As recommended by the Committee of the Whole, the draft resolution contained in 
document GC(44)/L.17 was adopted. 
41. Mr. WÃHLK (Denmark) said that the Danish Government had for years been a 
strong supporter of the AgencyÂs technical assistance programme, pledging and paying its full 
share of the TCF in a timely manner. It had already pledged its full share for 2001. However, 
as a country that had decided not to use nuclear power because the safety and waste storage 
issues remained unresolved, Denmark had consistently stated that its contribution to the TCF 
was made on the understanding that technical assistance should not be used for the general 
promotion of nuclear power. Unfortunately, the resolution on the AgencyÂs technical co-
operation activities which had been submitted to the current session of the General 
Conference fell somewhat short of that understanding and his country was therefore unable to 
join the consensus. 


Strengthening the effectiveness and improving the efficiency of the safeguards system 
and application of the Model Protocol (agenda item 16) 

42. Mr. FREEMAN (United Kingdom), clarifying the wording of preambular 
paragraph (k) of the draft resolution contained in document GC(44)/L.21, said that the words 
Âinter aliaÂ merely placed the two items constituting the remainder of that paragraph in the 
context from which they were drawn, namely the final document of the 2000 NPT Review 
Conference. 
43. Mr. RITCH (United States of America), supported by Mr. SHOUKRY (Egypt), 
proposed two minor amendments to the wording of the draft resolution. Firstly, the words Âto 
studyÂ in the first line of operative paragraph 4 should be replaced by Âto continue to studyÂ, 
since everyone was aware of the SecretariatÂs ongoing efforts in that regard. Secondly, the 
words Âstrengthened effortsÂ in operative paragraph 14(i) constituted a poor description of the 
diligence shown by the Director General in his endeavours to conclude safeguards agreements 
and additional protocols and should therefore be replaced by the words Âintensified effortsÂ. 
44. As recommended by the Committee of the Whole, with the amendments proposed by 
the representative of the United States, the draft resolution in document GC(44)/L.21 was 
adopted. 


Measures against illicit trafficking in nuclear materials and other radioactive sources 
(agenda item 17) 

45. As recommended by the Committee of the Whole, the draft resolution contained in 
document GC(44)/L.11 was adopted. 



Strengthening the agencyÂs activities related to nuclear science, technology and 
applications (agenda item 18) 

46. Mr. UMAR (Nigeria) said that the wording of operative paragraph 2 of the draft 
resolution contained in document GC(44)/L.20 should be amended to read ÂFurther requests 
the Director General to report on the feasibility and the resource implications of this 
resolution to the Board of GovernorsÂÂ 
47. As recommended by the Committee of the Whole, the draft resolutions contained in 
documents GC(44)/L.13, 14, 18 and 20, with the amendment to the latter resolution proposed 
by the representative of Nigeria, were adopted. 


Outcomes of the NPT Review Conference relevant to the activities of the IAEA (agenda 
item 19) 

48. As recommended by the Committee of the Whole, the draft resolution contained in 
document GC(44)/L.16 was adopted. 
49. Mr. BAR (Israel) said that, out of respect for the tradition of the General 
Conference and the efforts made by the Australian delegation and others to reach an 
agreement on the item in question, his delegation had decided not to block consensus. 
However, it did have reservations regarding the introduction of various parts of the final 
document of the 2000 NPT Review Conference into General Conference resolutions. The 
inclusion of the item on the agenda was itself inappropriate, as was the call for IAEA organs 
to act upon decisions taken by other fora by which not all Member States were bound. His 
delegationÂs decision not to block consensus should not be interpreted as an indication of its 
acceptance of any element of the final document of the 2000 NPT Review Conference. 
50. Mr. TIWARI (India), noting that his delegation had expressed its position on the 
issues under consideration during the discussions of the agenda in the second Plenary 
meeting, said that, despite its misgivings, it did not wish to block consensus. 


Election to the AgencyÂs Staff Pension Committee (agenda item 24) 

51. As recommended by the Committee of the Whole, Mr. Patrick Thema of South Africa 
was elected as an alternate member of the AgencyÂs Staff Pension Committee. 
52. The PRESIDENT thanked Mr. Gregoric, the Chairman of the Committee of the 
Whole, for his skilful guidance of the CommitteeÂs deliberations, and all delegations for the 
co-operation they had shown. 


CLOSING OF THE SESSION 

53. Mr. KADRI (Algeria) commended the President for the efficiency and wisdom he 
had shown in conducting the work of the General Conference. His human and professional 
qualities were recognized by all and did honour to his own country, all Arab countries, and all 
Member States of the Agency. In conclusion, he expressed the hope that the spirit of 



co-operation which had been so much in evidence at the current session of the General 
Conference would prevail at future sessions. 
54. Mr. RITCH (United States of America) echoed the sentiments of the 
representative of Algeria. 
55. Ms. QUINCY (France), speaking on behalf of the European Union, commended 
the President for the skill he had shown in guiding the work of the General Conference, 
thanks to which the majority of the decisions taken had been adopted without a vote. 
56. Mr. JOEDO (Indonesia), speaking on behalf of the Asian Group, expressed his 
sincere appreciation to the President and the Secretariat for the work they had done to make 
the General Conference a success. 
57. Mr. TIWARI (India), speaking on behalf of the MESA Group, thanked the 
President for the contribution he had made both to the work of the General Conference, and to 
the work of the MESA Group in electing its representative to the Board of Governors. 
58. Mr. HERRERA ANDRADE (Mexico), speaking on behalf of GRULAC, thanked 
the President and the Chairman of the Committee of the Whole for their efforts. 
59. Mr. UMAR (Nigeria), speaking on behalf of the African Group, commended the 
President for the skilful way he had conducted the work of the General Conference. He 
hoped that the resolutions and decisions which had been adopted would bear witness to the 
spirit of consensus in which the work had been carried out. 
60. Mr. SALEHI (Islamic Republic of Iran) expressed his appreciation for the able 
guidance provided by the President in the course of the work of the General Conference. He 
also thanked the Chairman of the Committee of the Whole and the Secretariat for their efforts. 
61. Mr. KENIK (Belarus), speaking on behalf of the Eastern Europe Group, 
congratulated the President on the successful conclusion of the General Conference and 
thanked the Chairman of the Committee of the Whole and the Secretariat. 
62. Mr. BAR (Israel) expressed his appreciation to the President for the efficient 
manner in which he had guided the work of the General Conference, and commended his 
leadership skills and impartiality which had helped the Conference come to a successful 
conclusion. 
63. The PRESIDENT thanked all participants for their co-operation, which had been 
a crucial factor in the success of the General Conference. He also thanked Mr. Gregoric of 
Slovenia and the Vice-Chairmen for their successful management of the work of the 
Committee of the Whole. Lastly, he thanked the Director General and his staff - including the 
interpreters, translators, prÃ©cis writers, Conference Service officers, printers and documents 
control officers - for their valuable support. 



64. Finally, in accordance with Rule 48 of the Rules of Procedure, he invited the 
Conference to observe one minute of silence dedicated to prayer or meditation. 


All present rose and observed one minute of silence. 

65. The PRESIDENT declared the forty-fourth regular session of the General 
Conference closed. 


The meeting rose at 7.25 p.m.
