The training courses for National Authorities personnel, addressing a wide range of

the practical aspects of implementing the Convention, continued to be valuable for

participating personnel from National Authorities, and especially for those from

countries with no chemical weapons and only a limited chemical industry. Interest in

the courses continued to exceed the availability of places in them. The demand for

basic training remained significant, partly as a result of the rotation of the personnel

of National Authorities, and partly because many National Authorities are still in a

formative phase. The Secretariat especially encourages participation from Member

States which have not previously participated in such courses, and which have newly

established National Authorities.
