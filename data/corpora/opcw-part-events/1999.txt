The training courses for National Authorities personnel, addressing a wide range of

the practical aspects of implementing the Convention, continued to be valuable for the

participating personnel from National Authorities. Interest in the courses continued to

exceed the availability of places in them. The demand for basic training remained

significant, partly as a result of the rotation of the personnel of National Authorities,

The second CW Chief Instructor Training Programme (CITPRO-II) was held at the

NBC Training Centre, AC-Laboratory Spiez, Switzerland, from 25 - 30 April 1999.

The course, which was jointly organised by the Government of Switzerland and the

OPCW, and which was attended by 40 chief instructors representing 33 States Parties,

benefited greatly from the experience gained through CITPRO-I, and aimed to assist

States Parties in their efforts to establish basic chemical weapons protection

capabilities which will directly benefit their civilian populations. The first Swiss

Emergency Field Laboratory Training Programme (SEF-Lab) was held in the same

location, from 14 - 19 November 1999. It was attended by 17 participants

representing 17 States Parties, who were chosen from about 90 candidates.

For the first time since the entry into force of the Convention the Secretariat organised

a joint meeting for National Authorities and representatives of the chemical industry,

just before the Fourth Session of the Conference. The two-day meeting was attended

by representatives of States Parties, participants from National Authorities and from

embassies in The Hague and Brussels, and representatives of chemical industry

associations. The meeting provided a forum for exchanges of experiences and

information amongst National Authorities, as well as between them and the

Secretariat, and was also a significant contribution to dialogue between the OPCW

and the chemical industry. An interesting feature of the meeting was the opportunity

for National Authorities to discuss issues in their respective regional contexts.

In order to be able to provide advice in accordance with the second part of paragraph

5 of Article X of the Convention, a number of States Parties were invited to nominate

experts who, together with experts from the Secretariat, may, for a limited period of

time, provide on-site expertise to help requesting States Parties to identify ways and

means of improving their protective capacity against chemical weapons. As of the

cut-off date for this report 19 States Parties had submitted the names of 43 experts for

this purpose. The first meeting of the protection network took place from

4 - 5 October 1999.
