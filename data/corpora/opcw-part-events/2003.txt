Events supported included an international workshop on the

analysis of chemicals related to the Convention, which was organised by the

Secretariat and the Finnish Institute for Verification of the Chemical Weapons

Convention (VERIFIN) and held in September in Helsinki, Finland; and a thematic

seminar for National Authorities, which took place in October in The Hague, and at

which international-cooperation programmes were reviewed.

In recognition of this need among most Member States, but

especially among those whose economies are either developing or in transition, the

theme for the annual protection workshop and the associated exhibition of equipment

was “National Response Systems to Protect against Chemical Emergencies”. Over

100 participants attended this two-day event, which is now a feature in the annual

calendar.

he situation in the Middle East in the early part of the year prompted Member States

in the region—Iran (Islamic Republic of), Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia—

to request advice, assessment visits, and training programmes for their civilian

populations. The Secretariat could not meet all these requests, but it was able to make

several assessment visits, offer two training programmes designed to build awareness

In the year under review the Secretariat launched a three-year project on national

capacity-building in the Central Asian Member States—Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan,

Kyrgyzstan, and Uzbekistan—with support from the governments of Norway and

Switzerland. Under this project four national protection courses were held in the

In 1999 the OPCW established a Protection Network to maintain its data bank on

protection and to be able to provide expert advice on request. The Network is

composed of experts who are highly qualified in the area of protection against

chemical-warfare agents and who can generate ideas on the development of the data

bank, serve as lecturers at protection-related training courses, and contribute in other

ways to the OPCW’s assistance operations

Under this Programme, support is extended to small-scale research projects in

countries whose economies are either developing or in transition, to promote the

development of scientific and technical knowledge in chemistry for purposes not

prohibited under the Convention. Forty-two such projects were supported in Africa,

Asia, and Latin America; 5 were funded solely by the OPCW, and the remaining

37 were funded jointly by the OPCW and the International Foundation for Science.

Laboratory Support Programme
Back

2003 [ 29993: 30330] 

This Programme extends support to analytical laboratories in countries whose

economies are either developing or in transition, so as to strengthen their capacities

for chemical analysis and monitoring. In 2003, support was extended to a laboratory

in Latvia so that it could upgrade its technical capabilities in pharmaceutical analysis.

The OPCW’s international-cooperation programmes stem from the provisions of

Article XI of the Convention relating to the economic and technological development

of States Parties. During the period under review, these programmes focussed on

strengthening economic and technological development through capacity-building,

and on facilitating exchanges of chemicals, equipment, and scientific and technical

information on the development and uses of chemistry for purposes not prohibited

under the Convention.
Back

2003 [ 26981: 27344] 

This Programme facilitates capacity-building and national implementation of the

Convention in the chemical industry, and research and development related to the

industry. It also aims to promote good practices in chemical manufacturing and safety,

and to enlarge the pool of human resources from which the National Authorities and

the OPCW can draw in the future.

chemical-industry associations of Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Italy,

Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland; the European Chemical Industry

Council (CEFIC); the World Customs Organisation, and several Dutch organisations

also cooperated in organising various components of the Programme. Even greater

participation by the chemical industry in the Programme will be crucial to its

continuing success.

The main objective of this Programme is to help scientists and engineers from

Member States whose economies are either developing or in transition to gain

experience by working for a limited period in an advanced laboratory or research

facility in another Member State. For the first time in 2003, the OPCW offered an

internship, designed to foster the development of analytical skills, at the OPCW

Laboratory.

This Programme facilitates the transfer of used but still-functional equipment from

institutions in States Parties that have phased it out and are ready to donate it to

publicly funded laboratories and research or academic institutions, most of which are

in countries whose economies are either developing or in transition. Seven

institutions in Africa, Eastern Europe, and Latin America, and one in Western Europe,

benefited under this Programme in 2003.
