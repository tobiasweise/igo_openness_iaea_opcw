In order to draw attention to mutual legal assistance amongst States Parties, and at the

request of the Conference, the OPCW, in February, hosted the international

symposium on cooperation and legal assistance for the effective implementation of

international agreements. The fact that the Conference at this session requested that a

workshop be organised on this subject, and that it was attended by over 40 panelists

and 200 participants, is reflective of the increasing attention and priority being given

by governments, academic institutions and the public to the enforcement of the ban on

chemical weapons.

Any new data submitted by Member States

for inclusion in the database undergoes a comprehensive peer review by a so-called

validation group. This group makes recommendations on the inclusion of new

validated spectra to the Director-General for reporting to the Council, which decides

on the inclusion of new data into the database. In 2001 the OPCW Laboratory

organised three validation group meetings to update the spectral data contained in the

OPCW Central Analytical Database, as is shown in the table below.

The ethics project, launched in 2001, was the OPCW’s contribution to the

work of the UN expert group on disarmament and non-proliferation

education. The project aims to educate academic and scientific communities

about the disarmament and non-proliferation objectives of the Convention,

and attempts to establish a “non-proliferation code of conduct” for

professionals working with chemicals. In 2001 an internal task force

undertook preliminary research to identify other international organisations

and institutions involved in similar endeavours, with a view to developing

possible synergies. A joint session with SIPRI was held with the same

objective.

by working for a limited period of time in advanced research laboratories/facilities in

industrialised countries. A particular objective of the programme is to facilitate

the targeted countries through capacity building. During 2001, the Secretariat

supported the internships of three scientists in areas of research which were relevant

to the object and purpose of the Convention.
