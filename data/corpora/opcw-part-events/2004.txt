Under this Programme, support is extended to small-scale research projects in

countries whose economies are either developing or in transition, to promote the

development of scientific and technical knowledge in chemistry for purposes not

prohibited under the Convention. Thirty-nine projects were supported in Africa, Asia,

The OPCW

can provide expert advice and training to Member States on methods of improving

their national capacities to protect against the use, or threat of use, of chemical

weapons. Assistance-and-protection programmes aim to strengthen these national

capacities, to coordinate the international response to the use of chemical weapons,

and to strengthen the Secretariat’s capacity to manage that response and coordinate

and deliver assistance to the requesting State Party or Parties.
