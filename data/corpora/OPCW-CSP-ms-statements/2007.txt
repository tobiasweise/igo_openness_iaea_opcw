2 December 2008 STATEMENT  on behalf of the AFRICAN STATES PARTIES TO THE CWC during the Thirteenth session of the Conference of States Parties 2 to 5 December 2008 
Mr. Chairman, 
1. 
Allow me, on behalf of the African States Parties to the Chemical Weapons Convention, to congratulate you on your election as Chairperson of the 13th session of the Conference of States Parties. We assure you of our full cooperation and support for your efforts to guide this sessions work to a successful conclusion. 

2. 
I also convey the African Groups appreciation to the outgoing Chairman, Ambassador Idris of Sudan, for his effective and efficient chairmanship of the 12th Conference of States Parties. 

3. 
The African Group associates	 itself with the statement made by the Chairperson of the Non-aligned Movement and China.  

4. 
The Group also thanks the Director-General for his opening statement on the activities of the Organisation. 

5. 
We wish to congratulate the Republic of Congo and Guinea Bissau which have acceded to the Convention during 2008, thereby increasing the membership of the Convention to 184 States Parties and bringing the total number of African States Parties to the Convention to 50. We also look forward to welcoming Lebanon who will be joining the Convention soon.  

Mr. Chairman, 

6.
 The 13th session of the Conference of States Parties takes place against the background of the successful outcome of the Second Review Conference of the Chemical Weapons Convention. African States Parties welcome the results of the Review Conference and stand ready to implement and build further on these outcomes in order to enhance international peace and security, as well as to ensure that the Convention stays relevant for its Member States. 


Mr. Chairman,

7. 
The African States Parties reiterate their firm conviction that the destruction of all chemical weapons remains the primary objective of this Organisation. We therefore welcome, and congratulate, A State Party on the destruction of its chemical weapons stockpile. This successful completion is an inspiration to all States Parties to continue to pursue the destruction of chemical weapons with vigour in order to rid the world of these weapons of mass destruction.  

8. 
African States Parties have taken note of the destruction efforts undertaken by the remaining possessor States Parties during the past year and we commend them for their efforts. However, we remain concerned at the large quantity of chemical weapons stockpiles that still has to be destroyed with less than four years remaining before the final destruction deadline. We call on the major possessor States Parties to ensure that they complete their destruction programmes within the deadlines provided for in the Convention and in accordance with the decisions of the 11th session of the CSP. 

Mr. Chairman, 

9. 
African State Parties have demonstrated strong commitment to the object and purpose of the Chemical Weapons Convention over the past number of years by making great strides in the implementation of their obligations under the Convention particularly in terms of the number of States Parties that have designated National Authorities as well as those engaged in legislative processes as part of their national implementation measures. We remain committed to implementing, in full, all of our obligations including those under Article VII of the Convention. 


10.It is important, however, that adequate and timely assistance be provided to requesting States Parties to assist them in this regard.  
11.We welcome the constructive spirit that currently exists amongst States Parties on the implementation of Article VII and support the efforts of the facilitator to guide our work to a successful conclusion. 
Mr. Chairman, 
12.The African Group of States Parties would like to acknowledge the positive steps which the Technical Secretariat is undertaking in implementing the Programme for Africa. We are encouraged by the enthusiasm and hard work of the International Cooperation and Assistance division which is helping to gradually establish effective and meaningful cooperation and assistance with African States Parties. 
13.We, however, appeal to the Technical Secretariat to intensify its efforts to identify and initiate new additional initiatives which could contribute directly to building capacity and transferring skills to African States Parties as well as assisting them with the implementation of the Convention. We look forward to 
2 

Check against delivery 
continued and fruitful cooperation with the Technical Secretariat that would lead to the establishment of further tangible actions and concrete projects for the implementation of the Programme. 
14.We call upon donor States Parties to realise additional voluntary contributions that could provide further substantial assistance to African States Parties, through the Programme for Africa. In this regard African States are ready and willing to work with donor States Parties to attain the objectives of the Programme. 
Mr. Chairman, 
15.The Second Review Conference urged the Executive Council to reach early agreement on the full implementation of Article XI as well as calling for adequate funding to be made available for capacity building and transfer of skills programmes. We welcome the existing international cooperation programmes of the Technical Secretariat and reiterate the importance of steadily increasing, on an annual basis, the amount of regular budget funding allocated for international cooperation as well as increasing its human resource capacity. This will allow the Organisations programmes to keep pace with the needs of States Parties. 
16.We fully support current efforts to explore ways of developing concrete measures, within an agreed framework, so as to ensure the promotion of international cooperation in the field of chemical activities through the exchange of scientific and technical information, chemicals and equipment.  
17.The full implementation of Article XI is of particular importance in order to make the Convention more relevant to a large number of States Parties that possess neither chemical weapons nor any substantial chemical industry. By assisting these States Parties in the development of their chemical capacity and industry we in turn greatly enhance their ability to contribute to the maintenance of international and regional peace and security. 
Mr. Chairman, 
18.African States Parties attach particular importance to the implementation of Article X which provides for assistance and protection to States Parties against chemical weapons. Important elements in the implementation of this Article include the need for practical capacity building as well as the transfer of material and equipment to deal with chemical incidents on a regional and sub-regional basis.  Current chemical industrial development as well as the transportation of large quantities of chemicals across borders, clearly calls for the broad application of this Article to enable it to address a wider range of chemical incidents. 
3 

Check against delivery 
19.It is therefore important that the current training and assistance programmes of the OPCW focus on establishing or strengthening States Parties capacity to respond to a chemical attack or incident. The Organisation should also evaluate, and adjust where necessary, its procedures for mobilising and coordinating assistance, including equipment, to ensure that it can adequately respond to requests from African States Parties. 
20.In this regard, African States Parties welcome the offer by the Government of Tunisia to host the next exercise on the delivery of assistance - ASSISTEX III 
- during the first half of 2010. This offer illustrates, once again, the commitment of African States Parties to the object and purposes of the Chemical Weapons Convention. We express our full support for the preparation of this important event and its successful outcome.  
Mr. Chairman, 
21.The threat of global terrorism which confronts us, gives added urgency to the work of our Organisation. African States Parties believe the OPCW has a role to play among international organisations in preventing access to chemical weapons by non-state actors and by providing assistance in the event of a chemical attack. In this framework, the implementation of Article X is of particular importance. 
22.We also believe that the OPCWs contribution to the fight against terrorism needs to be addressed in a substantive manner through the Open-ended Working Group on Terrorism. The African Group therefore calls for such consultations to be facilitated as soon as possible.   
23.We further welcome all positive collaboration and cooperation between the OPCW, States Parties, regional centres for counter-terrorism, such as the African Centre for the Study and Research on Terrorism, and other international organisations in combating the global threat of terrorism.  
Finally Mr. Chairman, 
24.We would urge the Technical Secretariat to ensure, through its recruitment processes, equitable geographical representation in the professional ranks of the Organisation, particularly in senior and management positions. 
25.The African Group would like to request that this statement be circulated as an official document of the 13th session of the Conference of States Parties. 
Thank you

STATEMENT 
on behalf of the 
AFRICAN STATES PARTIES TO THE CWC 
during the 
Twelfth session of   
the Conference of States Parties 
5 to 9 November 2007 

Mr. Chairman, 
Allow me, on behalf of the delegations of the African States Parties to the CWC, to congratulate you on your election as Chairperson of the 12th Session of the Conference of States Parties. We assure you of our full cooperation and support for your efforts to guide this sessions work to a successful conclusion.  
The African Group would like to thank the Director-General for his opening statement on the activities of the Organisation.  
We also associate ourselves with the statement made by the Chairperson of the Non-aligned Movement and China. 
Mr. Chairman, 
The African States Parties remain of the firm conviction that the destruction of all chemical weapons continues to be the primary objective of this Organisation. We therefore welcome, and congratulate, Albania as the first State Party to destroy its chemical weapons stockpile. 
This successful completion should serve as inspiration to all Member States to continue to pursue the destruction of chemical weapons with vigour in order to rid the world of these weapons of mass destruction.  
African States Parties take note of the ongoing destruction efforts of the other possessor States as well as their efforts to further enhance the destruction of their chemical weapons stockpiles. We call on these States Parties to continue to intensify their efforts to ensure that they complete their destruction programmes within the set deadlines, as stipulated in the relevant decisions of the 11th session of the CSP. 
Mr. Chairman, 
The African States Parties would like to reiterate their commitment to the object and purpose of the Convention as well as their determination to implement in full all their obligations under the Convention. We wish to note with satisfaction the 
1 

Check against delivery 
great strides, which have been made by African States Parties in the implementation of Article VII obligations, particularly the number of States Parties who have designated National Authorities as well as those engaged in legislative processes as part of their national implementation measures. 
In this regard, we wish to once again highlight the importance of ensuring adequate and timely assistance to States Parties, upon their request, in order to fulfil their obligations under Article VII. 
Mr. Chairman, 
We would like to welcome Barbados who has become a State Party to the Convention since the last Conference. 
The African States Parties are also showing their commitment to the Convention by making significant progress in attaining universality. In this regard we wish to congratulate the Republic of Congo who is in the process of submitting its instrument of ratification and we look forward to welcoming it shortly as the 183rd State Party to the Convention.   
With this positive step, only four African States out of a total of 53 are yet to become parties to the Convention. African States Parties are actively contributing to efforts to bring the remaining States into the CWC family by endeavouring to invite them to regional and sub-regional workshops and meetings, as well as by approaching each State on an individual basis. 
A further indication of the Regions commitment to the Convention is the various workshops, meetings and events held during this year. These include, amongst others, the Fifth Regional Meeting of National Authorities of States Parties in Africa held in Cameroon, the Workshop for senior government officials and stakeholders in Nigeria, the Workshop in Zambia for Customs Authorities on the Technical Aspects of the Transfers Regime, the Workshop on Universality the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) that was held in Algeria and the workshop for representatives of National Authorities in the Southern African Development Community (SADC) held in South Africa in July.  
Mr. Chairman, 
The African States Parties wish to reiterate their concern about the low level of representation of African nationals in the Technical Secretariat, and urge for the need for more equitable representation to enhance the involvement and commitment of Africa towards the Convention. 
Mr. Chairman, 
The threat of global terrorism, which confronts us today has given added urgency to the work of our Organisation, including the objective of achieving the 
2 

Check against delivery 
universality of the Convention and its full implementation.  African States Parties are convinced that the OPCW has a role to play in preventing access to chemical weapons by non-state actors and by providing assistance in the event of a chemical attack. In this framework, the implementation of Article X is of particular importance. 
We also welcome collaboration and cooperation between the OPCW, States Parties, regional centres for counter-terrorism, such as the African Union Centre in Algiers and other international organisations in combating the global threat of terrorism. 
Mr. Chairman, 
As regards the status of implementation of Article X, the African States Parties note with appreciation, the efforts of the Technical Secretariat to enhance assistance and protection against chemical weapons.  We have taken note of the Technical Secretariats intention to organise sub-regional train the trainer programmes on protection and emergency response. In this regard we believe such assistance programmes should take into account the need for practical capacity building as well as the transfer of material and equipment to deal with chemical incidents on a regional and sub-regional basis.  
The African States Parties, however, wish to call on the Organisation to take into consideration their special needs and to tailor its assistance accordingly.   
African States Parties also encourage the Technical Secretariat to evaluate, and adjust where necessary, its procedures for mobilising and coordinating assistance to ensure that it can adequately respond to requests from African States Parties. 
Mr. Chairman, 
The African States Parties to the OPCW endorse the proposed Programme for Africa, which has been developed by the Technical Secretariat on the initiative of the Director-General. 
We request that the Programme be implemented as soon as possible, keeping in mind the suggestions and inputs which we have made. In this regard it is also important to continuously refine and adjust the Programme so that it adequately addresses the needs of African States Parties. 
Mr. Chairman, 
Recalling the decisions C-10/DEC.13 and C-11/DEC.10 of the Conference of States Parties to establish an OPCW Office in Africa, the African States Parties 
3 

Check against delivery 
will continue their efforts in cooperation with States Parties and the Technical Secretariat to establish an office on the Continent to further support States Parties endeavours to achieve universality in the Region and fully implement the Convention.  We reiterate our call for the appointment of a new facilitator on the Office in Africa and the reactivation of the working group in this regard.  
Mr. Chairman, 
The African States Parties wish to recall decision C-10/DEC.14 of the Conference of States Parties on the full implementation of Article XI, as well as the recommendation of the 11th session of the Conference that the Council enhances its deliberations on this agenda item. 
We are of the view that Article XI is still not being implemented at the same level and with the same intensity as the other provisions of the Convention.  
African States Parties also do not receive sufficient international cooperation to assist with the development of chemical industries on the Continent as well as the transfer of technology to it. We reiterate our call for a strong commitment to the implementation of Article XI, including the adoption of a plan of action.  
We therefore look forward to the adoption of a decision by this session of the Conference of State Parties on the need to fully implement Article XI. 
Mr. Chairman, 
Allow me also in this regard to refer to the Programme and Budget of the OPCW, and the need to improve the balance in the allocation of resources to the key programmes and activities in the regular budget. 
The African States Parties call on the Director-General to allocate more human and financial resources in the 2009 Programme and Budget, for the capacity building and skills transfer programmes of the International Cooperation and Assistance Division, which contribute to the implementation of Article XI. These programmes benefit the majority of States Parties to the Convention and the resources currently allocated to it, are not sufficient to address the demand that exists for such assistance. 
Mr. Chairman 
As regards the Second Review Conference, the African Group is working with other States Parties through the Open-ended Working Group to prepare for the Conference. We are looking forward to a thorough evaluation process of the Conventions implementation as well as considering ways of further strengthening the Convention and maintaining its relevance for all States Parties beyond 2012.

Finally Mr. Chairman, 
On behalf of the African Group I would like to congratulate States Parties, the Director-General and the Technical Secretariat on the 10th Anniversary of the entry into force of the Chemical Weapons Convention, as well as the inauguration on 9 May this year, of the memorial to all victims of chemical weapons. In this regard several commemorative events were also held on the Continent this year, further illustrating our commitment to the object and purpose of the Convention. 
Thank you

The OPCW itself demonstrates the possibilities that multilateralism offers for advancing towards the achievement of a better world. It is an example of humanitys commitment to a world free of WMDs, be they chemical, nuclear o biological.

the OPCW Mr. Zokey Ahad to the 12th Conference of the States Parties to the 
CWC 
05 November to 09 November, 2007 

Mr. Chairman, 
Please accept our heartiest congratulations on your well deserved election. We remain confident that given your wide experience and diplomatic skills you would ably steer our work to a successful outcome. We also take this opportunity to convey our deep appreciation for the excellent work of the outgoing Chair Ambassador Alfonso Dastis of the 11th Conference. Our compliment is also to Director-General Rogelio Pfirter and his colleagues at the Secretariat for their untiring work. The comprehensive statement of the Director General presented to the CSP, has indeed set the tone of our deliberations.   
Mr. Chairman, 
Our delegation associates itself fully with the statement made by the distinguished Ambassador of Cuba on behalf of NAM and China. However, we have requested for the floor to highlight some points that we strongly subscribe to. Presently, international attention is focused on finding the best ways and means in which major threats to individual and collective security could be best addressed. In this context, the full and non-discriminatory implementation of the Convention on the Chemical Weapons would ensure the elimination of an entire category of weapons of mass destruction. We need to pursue this objective with determination and steadfastness. 
We are pleased to note that the Convention is reaching near universality and let me take this opportunity to welcome Barbados as the newest member State Party of the OPCW, who is attending the Conference for the first time. We hope that countries which are still outside its regime particularly, those whose non-adherence has serious ramifications for regional and global security would join the Convention very soon. As prime objective of the CWC is to rid the world of a very specific category of weapons of mass destruction, we would thus urge upon all possessor states, mainly the major ones to gear up their efforts in complying with the time schedule as enshrined in the Convention for the complete destruction of the weapons. We would like to congratulate Albania in this regard.  
Mr. Chairman, 
Bangladesh greatly values the assistance and cooperation it has received so far, from the Organization and also through the voluntary contribution of member states in areas of capacity building and exchange of knowledge and expertise. At the same time, we would welcome assistance programmes in the area of protection. We would also support any such programmes that contribute to the promotion of international cooperation in transfer of technology, material and equipments for peaceful use in the field of chemicals. We would therefore, urge removal of all discriminatory restrictions on such transfers which hamper or has the potential to hamper economic and technological development of state parties, particularly the developing ones. 
(Please check against delivery) 
Mr. Chairman, 
Bangladesh has observed in a befitting manner the 10th Anniversary of the CWC this year. Notwithstanding our many constraints, Bangladesh has taken a series of measures to fulfill the treaty obligations. Recently, we have adopted our National Legislation on the Convention. Its effective implementation will however, depend on necessary financial and technical support. In this regard, we look forward to the continued support and assistance from the Technical Secretariat. Bangladesh is willing to receive routine as well as challenge inspections, if any, from OPCW as per terms of the verification regime established under the convention. Bangladesh is participating in all the Annual Conferences of States Parties and the Meetings of the National Authorities. We have already provided the OPCW with the points of entry in connection with the Inspection, standing diplomatic clearance number and radio frequency for HF communication. Bangladesh National Authority for CWC also makes use of the OPCW Conference Support Programme and Project for Laboratory Assistance time to time and arranges financial assistance from the OPCW for various Seminars / Workshops / Activities organized by different scientific organizations in Bangladesh. 
Mr. Chairman, 
Our National Legislation on the implementation of the CWC in Bangladesh is already approved by the Government. Review of the previously existing relevant laws and implementation of laws in the country is a very important task. To ensure proper implementation of the laws and meet the obligations under the convention, Bangladesh National Authority for CWC will need to be arranged in a formal structure. For this purpose, Bangladesh National Authority for CWC initiated a detail plan of action. 
Mr. Chairman, 
Bangladesh delegation strongly urges that recruitment to the Organisation should pay due regard to the principles of equitable geographical and gender representation.        
Mr. Chairman, 
I would like to conclude by reiterating Bangladeshs strong and unequivocal commitment to the CWC. We were one of the very first countries to sign and ratify the CWC.  It would be our continuous endeavor to see to the full and effective implementation of the Convention. 
I thank you all. 
OPCW Conference of the States Parties 
Twelfth Session C-12/NAT.2 5  9 November 2007 7 November 2007 ENGLISH only 
STATEMENT BY MS ERICA NG, 
ASSISTANT DIRECTOR-GENERAL OF TRADE AND INDUSTRY 
OF THE HONG KONG SPECIAL ADMINISTRATIVE REGION OF 
THE PEOPLES REPUBLIC OF CHINA, 
AT THE TWELFTH SESSION OF THE CONFERENCE OF THE STATES PARTIES 
TO THE CHEMICAL WEAPONS CONVENTION 

Mr. Chairman,  
Distinguished Delegates, 
I am the Assistant Director-General of Trade and Industry of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China.  It is a great pleasure for me to be here today to attend the Twelfth Session of the Conference of States Parties to the Chemical Weapons Convention. 
On 1 July 1997, the People's Republic of China resumed the exercise of its sovereignty over Hong Kong. On the same day, the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) of the Peoples Republic of China took effect.  The Basic Law is the constitutional document setting forth the various systems to be applied in the HKSAR.  Its Article 153 stipulates that The application to the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of international agreements to which the People's Republic of China is or becomes a party shall be decided by the Central People's Government, in accordance with the circumstances and needs of the Region, and after seeking the views of the government of the Region. 
As the People's Republic of China is a State Party to the Chemical Weapons Convention, the Central People's Government has extended its application to the HKSAR in accordance with Article 153 of the Basic Law. In accordance with the principle of One country, Two systems and the relevant provisions of the Basic Law, the HKSAR Government passed the Chemical Weapons (Convention) Ordinance in 2003, which came into effect in June 2004. Since then, the Chemical Weapons Convention has been implemented fully and effectively in the HKSAR. Now I would like to give you an overview of how the main provisions of the Convention are implemented in the HKSAR. 
Firstly, to implement the general obligations of the State Parties to the Convention, i.e., to ban the use and development of chemical weapons and to destroy chemical weapons and the related production facilities they possess, the HKSAR's Chemical Weapons (Convention) Ordinance prohibits the use, development, production, acquisition, stockpiling, retaining or participating in the transfer of a chemical weapon.  It also prohibits any engagement in 
CS-2007-5343(E) distributed 08/11/2007 *CS-2007-5343.E* 
C-12/NAT.2 page 2 
military preparations intending to use a chemical weapon.  Breaches of these provisions constitute offences, and the maximum penalty is life imprisonment upon conviction on indictment.  The Ordinance also provides Hong Kong's customs authorities with full powers to facilitate effective enforcement.  Our customs officers may, for example, examine goods, require that goods are stored in designated places for monitoring of their movement, enter and search any premises, stop, board, search, and detain a vessel, aircraft or vehicle, examine or investigate any suspicious articles, take samples or evidence of suspicious articles, and arrest and prosecute persons who violate the law. 
Secondly, the Convention has provided for requirements on declarations, i.e., States Parties shall declare their activities, if any, with respect to chemical weapons or scheduled chemicals, or their discrete organic chemical (DOC) production facilities. In this connection, in accordance with the Chemical Weapons (Convention) Ordinance which took effect in 2004, the HKSAR has established a permit and notification system, which requires that anybody who produces, acquires, retains a scheduled chemical in his facility, or uses, transfers and consumes a scheduled chemical in excess of a prescribed amount, or processes it, must have a permit. The Ordinance has also provided that the permit holder and operator of a DOC production facility must submit to the HKSAR's Trade and Industry Department, within a prescribed timeline, the operation data of the facility and other relevant information as required by the Convention, and the facility must be subject to examination and inspection by the customs authorities. 
To fulfil the requirements on declarations, we collect information acquired under our Ordinance and submitted HKSAR's initial declarations to the OPCW through the Central Peoples Government in 2004, which included the following aspects: 
(a) 	
we do not have any chemical weapons storage or production, or any declarable activities involving Schedule 1 chemicals; 

(b) 	
we have some import/export activities involving Schedule 2 and 3 chemicals; and 

(c) 	
we have one DOC production facility. 


Subsequent to the initial declarations, we have submitted annual declarations on these activities to the OPCW through the Central People's Government. 
Thirdly, the Convention has provided that States Parties shall provide access to relevant sites and activities in their territories and provide assistance for inspection teams from the Secretariat. In order to meet this requirement, HKSAR's Chemical Weapons (Convention) Ordinance has provided our customs authorities with the power to issue an authorisation in respect of the inspection in question, authorising the inspection team members to exercise within the specified area all the rights of access as are conferred on them by the Verification Annex, in order to facilitate their inspection activities in Hong Kong. 
In conclusion, HKSAR has implemented the provisions of the Chemical Weapons Convention fully.  In order to better implement the Convention, the Government has established a compliance office involving all relevant departments of the HKSAR to coordinate all the necessary work arising from the Convention and the relevant Ordinance, including policy development, licensing and reporting, law enforcement and technical assistance etc. 
C-12/NAT.2 page 3 
The HKSAR will continue to work closely with the international community, through the Central People's Government, to ensure the full and effective implementation of the Chemical Weapons Convention in HKSAR by way of comprehensive legislations and stringent law enforcement. 
Thank you, Mr Chairman.

Twelfth Session C-12/NAT.3 5  9 November 2007 9 November 2007 Original: ENGLISH 
STATEMENT BY THE NETHERLANDS PERMANENT REPRESENTATIVE, 
MR MAARTEN W. J. LAK, TO THE TWELFTH SESSION OF THE CONFERENCE 
OF THE STATES PARTIES UNDER ANY OTHER BUSINESS 
9 NOVEMBER 2007 

Tenth Anniversary Activities  
The Netherlands perspective on follow-up 
Mr Chairman, Director General, distinguished delegates.  
1. 	
I take the floor to share some thoughts about a follow-up to the successful activities by which we have celebrated the Tenth Anniversary of the Chemical Weapons Convention and the OPCW this year. 

2. 	
As the Note by the Director General on the Tenth Anniversary, distributed last week, has made clear, the way we have organised synergy between States Parties, the Technical Secretariat and stakeholders for this celebration was the key to its success. This has been noted beyond our Organisation. And it also contributes to a positive outreach that our Convention merits.  

3. 	
That impact beyond the core of the OPCW, in the wider international world, in my view, is essential. Essential, for the OPCW to remain a successful example of multilateralism that works.  

4. 	
It is the stake-holders approach that has become the basic pattern of our work for the celebration. Practically speaking that meant an association of voluntary contributions, both in ideas, personnel and financial resources. The Technical Secretariat, the States Parties as well as academic research circles and NGOs, but above all industry, have jointly brought to life the programme for the Tenth Anniversary.  The OPCW would not have been able to celebrate the way we did, without the wider group of stakeholders taking an active and very much appreciated role. 

5. 	
This modus operandi should and can continue to guide us. How to exploit the results obtained this year in the various debates, national and international conducted in the Tenth Anniversary framework? We are beginning to think about that. As the Netherlands we are proud to have brought into this circle TNO, Clingendael, but also industry and protection specialists. They all stand ready to continue their renewed 


CS-2007-5351(E) distributed 14/11/2007 	*CS-2007-5351.E* 
C-12/NAT.3 page 2 
association with the OPCW.  My own Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Mayor of The Hague, Mr Wim Deetman and their respective staffs, have been crucial supporters for many activities.  
6. 	
Now it is upon us to exploit an investment we have all made together.  By activities for the Tenth Anniversary celebration. We need to pursue the avenues that have been opened up. Just think of the High Level Meeting on 27 September at New York, the symposia at Berlin, Rome, Brussels, and Columbia Law School and elsewhere; the academic forum and the industry forum, both held in The Hague very recently. Results of these two fora may also help the preparatory work underway for the Second Review Conference, as may also the commemorative book on the Creation of the OPCW, edited by Ian Kenyon, and launched on 9 May when HM Queen Beatrix paid our Organisation a visit to inaugurate the Memorial to all Victims of Chemical Warfare. 

7. 	
With all that in mind, we can organise our work on the OPCWs future more systematically and purposefully.  Some pieces of that jigsaw puzzle are already on the table. 

8. 	
Both the industry and the research community have proposed to share and to dialogue on issues essential to future relevance of our Convention.  I hope we will take them up on their offer. Can we for example have dedicated seminars with partners from industry and research annually? Can we also, within our structure of consultations and reports to the Conference, organise our deliberations on a continuous basis with the Technical Secretariat in support, to make the OPCW fit for the future? 

9. 	
Of course, as Host Country to the OPCW, the Netherlands stand ready to support as our tradition commands, such activities to the best of our abilities. 


Thank you for your attention.

OPCW Conference of the States Parties 
Twelfth Session C-12/NAT.4 5  9 November 2007 6 November 2007 ENGLISH only 
STATEMENT BY ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF STATE FOR  
VERIFICATION, COMPLIANCE AND IMPLEMENTATION,  
PAULA A. DESUTTER, UNITED STATES DELEGATION TO THE  
TWELFTH SESSION OF THE CONFERENCE OF THE STATES PARTIES  
6 NOVEMBER 2007 

Status of the implementation of the Convention  
Mr Chairman, Mr Director-General, Distinguished Delegates,  
It is a great pleasure once again to join Ambassador Javits and the U.S. Delegation in underscoring U.S. verification, compliance and implementation interests in this notable body. I want to thank you, Mr Chairman, and the other officers of the Conference, for another opportunity to do so, and for taking on the responsibility for guiding this distinguished body of delegates through the important work that is before the Conference of the States Parties this week. 
Three years ago, at the Ninth Conference of the States Parties, I had the honour to share with you the United States process and views on verification, compliance and compliance enforcement.  I explained the rigorous effort undertaken by the United States to formulate compliance judgments and urged States Parties to take seriously their role in this effort by understanding that each and every Party not only has the right, but the responsibility, to assess and draw its own conclusions about the compliance of its treaty partners.  We all must continue to be diligent in this area in order to ensure the success of this Organisation and the common goal to exclude completely the possible use of chemical weapons.  The concerns I outlined then  including the collective responsibility to follow through on compliance concerns - have been reinforced by unfolding events over the past three years, particularly, the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty with Iran and North Korea. These events serve to demonstrate in concrete terms why all of us should care about compliance.   
Mr Chairman, this Organisation has many reasons to be proud.  This year alone is noteworthy as we celebrated the Tenth Anniversary of the Chemical Weapons Convention, took note of the historic achievement by Albania in becoming the first possessor State Party to eliminate its entire chemical weapons stockpile, watched the membership of the OPCW grow to 182 States Parties encompassing 98% of the global population, welcomed an increased number of States Parties moving ahead with the completion of their national implementation requirements under Article VII. Though more must be done, a collegial effort is underway to prepare for what we all anticipate will be a successful Review Conference in April 2008.  The 
CS-2007-5382(E) distributed 07/12/2007 *CS-2007-5382.E* 
C-12/NAT.4 page 2 
OPCW has accomplished a great deal over the last decade and continues to set the standard for effective multilateralism through cooperation and steady progress.  We remain optimistic that such progress will continue under the leadership of the Director-General, with the hard work and effort of the Technical Secretariat and strong support and commitment by Member States. 
Mr Chairman, Ive come here today to congratulate this Organisation, but also to urge that we do not become complacent in achievements.  Challenges lie ahead. 
Some of these challenges are already at our door step, such as the ongoing scientific developments in the area of chemical technology and the potential that such technology can be diverted to a chemical weapons programme.  If this Organisation is to continue to fulfill its promise into the future, it must keep in mind that the CWCs viability is contingent upon its effective verifiability. Let me be clear. This does not, and should not be taken to mean that there is, or ever can be, certainty that a violation will always be detected.  However, effective verification should provide reasonable confidence that, under the circumstances, detection of noncompliance will occur in sufficient time for appropriate remedial responses to be undertaken, in order to reduce the threat presented by the violation, as well as to deny the violator the benefits of his wrongdoing. The United States strongly believes that verification facilitates both deterrence and detection of non-compliance, and is an essential component of the Convention, and part of what we consider the compliance process, which includes compliance assessments and compliance enforcement. 
Mr Chairman, it is vital that the Organisation keep abreast of scientific and technological developments in the way chemicals are developed, produced and used, advances in monitoring technology, continued reorganisation and diffusion of chemical industry operations and operational management.  We cannot afford to fall behind the advancement and evolution of the chemical industry if this treaty is to stand the test of time. We have to make sound recommendations that will ensure that verification keeps pace with changes in both the industry and the chemical weapons threat. 
In light of such developments, I urge member States to renew their awareness of their obligation to fully implement and comply with the provisions of Article I, often referred to as the General Purpose Criterion. The fundamental objective of the Chemical Weapons Convention is to eliminate the threat posed by chemical weapons. The General Obligations for States Parties in Article I identify the core measures to attain this objective. These core measures include the commitment by States to never under any circumstances use, develop, produce, otherwise acquire, stockpile or retain chemical weapons.  These measures also include the obligation never to assist, encourage or induce, in any way, anyone to engage in any activity prohibited to a State Party under the Convention.  Let me also emphasise that States Parties must recognise that the chemical weapons threat goes beyond the chemicals noted in the Schedules of Chemicals.  Additionally, the risk or the threat of use of toxic chemicals by non-State actors is also a reality, and should strengthen our resolve to fully implement our obligations in this area and work together to completely diminish any possibility of use by State or non-State actors.  Here I would only note the important linkage to U.N. Security Council Resolution 1540. 
C-12/NAT.4 page 3 
Mr Chairman, though the destruction of CW production facilities usually receives less attention than the destruction of CW stockpiles, it is an important aspect of the OPCWs work, since it focuses on eliminating the declared capacity of States Parties to produce additional chemical weapons.  While welcoming the near elimination of the worlds declared CW production capacity, it is also important for this body not to dismiss the possibility that some States Parties may have made preparations for possible future production of chemical agents, including retaining a CW production mobilisation capability.  This could take the form of designating existing industrial facilities for potential CW production, or, in the most alarming situation, deliberatively establishing dual use facilities, under military or government control, that nominally are for purposes not prohibited by the Convention, but can be quickly converted to CW-related production if directed.  Any preparations for such activity would be a violation of the Convention; this Organisation should be alert to such possibilities.  It is important in this context to recall the options available to States Parties under Article IX to pursue concerns. One significant change the Organisation can pursue to make Article IX consultations and visits more productive is to ensure that reports, particularly the Verification and Implementation Report, better known as the VIR, include information that is not proprietary. 
Mr Chairman, Im under no illusion that the only challenges facing this Organisation are the ones only beginning to emerge.  We all know there are a number of existing challenges facing this distinguished body, such as selection methodology and the inspection rate of other chemical production facilities, better known as OCPFs. As we continue to work toward an acceptable methodology for selecting such facilities for inspection, it is important to develop an approach that will give States Parties confidence that such sites are not being used for purposes prohibited by the Convention. The proportion of OCPFs inspected is still very low and doesnt give much confidence of detecting, or even deterring possible violations. Im aware of some of the concerns by States Parties regarding frequency, and understand the issue of equitable distribution, but our objective should be to ensure that these sites do not pose a risk to the object and purpose of the Convention. The Director-General has worked hard and provided member states a constructive interim approach, but I would encourage this body to accelerate its efforts to work out an acceptable resolution. 
Mr Chairman, as you know one of the core obligations of the Convention is the complete destruction of chemical weapons stocks by Possessor States.  This has always been of great interest and concern for many in this Organisation - as it should be. As Ambassador Javits noted in his opening statement, significant progress has been made on CW destruction, but there is more left to be done.  The United States will continue to do its part by completely destroying its CW stockpile in a manner that is safe and environmentally sound and will do so as soon as possible. I urge the other Possessor States to completely destroy their chemical weapons in a manner that is safe, secure and in accordance with the CWC.  CW stocks should be destroyed in such a way that the chemical agents are converted in an essentially irreversible manner to a form unsuitable for production of CW, that renders munitions and other devices completely unusable, and finally, that ensure that this process is subject to full verification by the Technical Secretariat.  Anything less does not constitute destruction pursuant to the Convention. 
Mr Chairman, I also would like to commend this Organisation for its work in recognising the need to strengthen its ability to respond rapidly and effectively to a request for an investigation of alleged use.  The development and maintenance of a strong capability to conduct thorough, expert investigations into allegations of CW use continues to be an C-12/NAT.4 page 4 
important function and a vital verification tool, particularly in the area of bio-medical sampling and analysis.  This continues to be of great interest to me and my Government as we welcome the progress that has been made to date. I urge this organisation to continue to support efforts that will ensure Technical Secretariat readiness in this area.  
Mr Chairman, I want to encourage those States Parties that have not moved forward with their implementing legislation and establishment of National Authorities as required under Article VII to do so, and to keep their colleagues and the Technical Secretariat apprised of their progress. There are approximately 20 States Parties with organic chemical manufacturing and trading activities that have not enacted comprehensive legislation, in accordance with their national implementation requirements.  The United States encourages these States Parties to quickly enact legislation, and we encourage the Technical Secretariat and all States Parties to urgently assist these member States in coming into compliance. These provisions are required by all States Parties and compliance with these obligations strengthen global efforts to make it more difficult for State and non-State actors that seek to violate laws and the provisions set forth in the Convention.  There must be continuity from the domestic level to the international level.  Not doing so risks weakening a key provision of this treaty and our fight against global terrorism. There must not be a break in the link.  There are also States Parties that have never made an initial declaration to the OPCW. Submission of declarations is a fundamental treaty requirement; States Parties that have not made initial declarations should work with the OPCW Technical Secretariat to move quickly to do so.  
Mr Chairman, Mr Director-General, Distinguished Delegates, as we move closer to the Second Review Conference, the Organisation brings with it a long list of achievements, concrete progress, and a strong commitment to put the Organisation and its objectives first - laying aside any obstruction and pessimism that would hinder progress. This has been the kind of collaborative spirit, and mutual effort that has served this Organisation well. Let us continue to remain vigilant - knowing that the Convention and its implementation contribute to enhancing international peace and security, and emphasising that its full, universal and effective implementation and strict compliance will contribute further to that purpose by excluding completely, for the sake of all humankind, the possibility of the use of chemical weapons. We have much to be pleased about, but a great deal more remains to be done.  The United States will continue to do its part, and stands ever willing to assist others in doing the same.  
Thank you, Mr Chairman.

STATEMENT OF CANADA 

TWELFTH SESSION OF  
THE CONFERENCE OF STATES PARTIES TO  
THE CHEMICAL WEAPONS CONVENTION 

DELIVERED BY 
MR. LOUIS-PHILIPPE SYLVESTRE 
NATIONAL COORDINATOR 
CANADIAN NATIONAL AUTHORITY FOR  
THE CHEMICAL WEAPONS CONVENTION 
FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND INTERNATIONAL TRADE CANADA 

     The Hague 5 November 2007        (CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY) 
Mr. Chairman, Mr. Director-General, Excellencies, distinguished Delegates and Honoured Guests: 
First let me congratulate you, Mr. Chairman, on your election to your office.  I am confident that your considerable diplomatic skills will contribute importantly to a positive outcome at this Conference; you can be assured of the full cooperation and support of the Canadian Delegation. 
Long a strong supporter of multilateral arms control and disarmament, Canada attaches high importance to the Chemical Weapons Convention.  Effective implementation of its distinctive verification regime is vital to enhancing international confidence that the goal of a complete ban on chemical weapons is being achieved in reality.  Such increased confidence in turn facilitates the growth of trade and cooperation for the use of chemistry for peaceful purposes. 
As we have been this year celebrating ten years of generally effective Treaty implementation, there have been grounds for modest satisfaction as well as areas of persisting concern. The number of States Parties has continued to increase and, at 182, seems to be drawing ever closer to the goal of universality.  Nevertheless, several important States have not yet adhered to the Convention and they ought to receive our concerted political encouragement to join our ranks as soon as possible.  Moreover, among States Parties, there remain a disconcertingly large number which have yet to take the necessary measures to meet their key Convention obligations.  Our cooperative work, 
- 2 -

with the Technical Secretariat, to assist each other in meeting our national obligations has resulted in considerable progress, but these efforts clearly need to be sustained and directed especially toward accelerating the passage of domestic legislation. 
Mr. Chairman, Canada has been pleased to note the recent increased levels of destruction of chemical weapons by possessor States; the Russian Federation in particular is now making good progress and merits our praise.  Also, we highly commend Albania for its achievement as the first State Party to complete the destruction of its chemical weapons.  However, with well over 50% of total chemical weapons stockpiles still not destroyed, the situation is not entirely reassuring. The verified destruction of all CW stockpiles within time frames specified in the Convention must remain an over-riding objective for us all, and the monitoring actions decided on by the Executive Council this year well reflect this concern. 
In the first decade of CWC implementation, there has been a gradual strengthening of the implementation of the Article VI verification provisions.  The number of Article VI inspections has been increased. Several important decisions clarifying declaration requirements for Article VI plant sites have been taken.  There have been notable efficiency gains in Article VI inspections. The use of sampling and analysis in selected  inspections of Schedule 2 plant sites has got under way.  Also, the initiative of the Director-General to modify the Technical Secretariats site selection methodology for  
- 3 -

Other Chemical Production Facilities (OPCFs), to be implemented commencing in January 2008, will go some way toward expanding coverage and reducing inequities in the distribution of Article VI inspections among States Parties.  These have all been positive developments. 
However, on balance, Canada considers 2007 to have been a disappointing year in terms of its contribution to further strengthening of the Article VI verification regime.  No effort was made to reach a decision on the issue of low concentrations for declarations of Schedule 2A and 2A* plant sites, thus allowing this serious gap in implementation of the Article VI verification provisions to persist.  Moreover, despite much hard work, we prolonged our failure to meet our responsibility under the Convention to agree on how proposals by States Parties are to be integrated into a comprehensive OCPF site selection methodology.  Work on this issue needs to continue, as does study on how OCPF inspections might be more effectively targeted.  Although there was near-unanimity on a decision text addressing the issue of late declarations, the Executive Council found itself unable to take a decision. Also, the Executive Council has recommended a 2008 Program and Budget which fails to maintain the pattern of gradually increasing the number of OCPF inspections, which had been implemented for several consecutive years.  Canada hopes 2008 will see a better record of achievement in these respects. 
Since the important decision of the Tenth Conference Session on implementation of Article XI, the level of resources devoted to International Cooperation and Assistance  
- 4 -

activities have gradually increased each year, even though these were years of zero 
growth budgets. Canada is pleased that this pattern is maintained in the Program and 
Budget recommendation for 2008. The dialogue in which we are engaged on Article XI 
issues has in our view increased understanding on all sides and ought to be maintained, 
with a view to defining with greater precision agreed ways in which we can build on past 
decisions and achievements and meet our shared objectives. 

The OPCW seems in generally good institutional health.  The overall verification 
provisions are being implemented effectively and with ever increasing efficiency.  The 
fact of a third consecutive Program and Budget with zero real growth, while 
accommodating continued increases in verification and ICA program activities, testifies 
to the effective work of Director-General Pfirter and his senior management team.  An 
area which will require our continued alertness is the implementation of tenure policy.  It 
is clear that this currently places some strains on the Organisations operational capacities 
and could have worrying cumulative consequences.  In response to earlier proposals by 
the Director-General, the Conference has already taken decisions to modify 
implementation of this policy.  The situation should continue to be closely monitored and 
we should be ready to make further adjustments as necessary and appropriate. 

Mr. Chairman,  
In April of next year we are to hold our Second Review Conference.  The word review, 
for some, may imply a backward-looking evaluation.  While assessment of our past  

- 5 -

achievements and shortcomings will doubtless be an important part of our work, Canada hopes that the Review Conference will be primarily a forward-looking event.  Rapid scientific and technological development is but one of the one of the factors which is significantly altering the milieu in which Convention implementation must be carried out.  International politics and market dynamics, as well as evolving commercial practices, also have their roles in bringing about global redistributions of chemical industry activities and significant changes in ownership and trading patterns.  The potential for misuse of chemicals for terrorist purposes is also increasingly a matter of concern on the international stage.  All such developments have operational implications for the effective implementation of arms control verification and the promotion of peaceful cooperation and development within the framework of the CWC.  The Review Conference ought to be occasion for us to initiate work and study procedures which will help us to maintain the continued effectiveness of Convention implementation into the indefinite future.   
Mr. Chairman, Canada sees the Chemical Weapons Convention as one of the foundation stones of the larger edifice of international law and practice which the international community is  painstakingly building up in the area of arms control and disarmament, in the hope of building confidence in a safer and more cooperative world.  The contribution that the  OPCW can make to this lofty objective is a consequential one.  With this outlook, we are eager to join together with other States Parties in working to ensure that this Session of the Conference contributes positively to this goal.  
(Check Against Delivery) 
Statement by H.E. Ambassador Xue Hanqin, 
Permanent Representative of the Peoples Republic of China 
To the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, 
At the Twelfth Session of the Conference of States Parities 
To the Chemical Weapons Convention 

(5 November 2007, the Hague) 
Mr Chairman, 
Please allow me, first of all, on behalf of the Chinese delegation, to congratulate you on your election as Chairperson of the current session of the Conference. I am confident that your rich diplomatic experiences and outstanding abilities will surely guide this session to success. The Chinese delegation is ready for full cooperation with you and other delegations. I would also like to take this opportunity to express our appreciation for the excellent work done by your predecessor Ambassador Alfonso Dastis from Spain. 
Mr Chairman, 
Over the past year, deep and profound changes continue to take place in the area of international security. Peace and development remain the theme of our times, and it is an irresistible trend of the time to secure peace, seek development and promote cooperation. At the same time, elements of dissonance and instability still exist, and the intertwining threats to security, both conventional and unconventional, pose a new challenge to the international community. Against this backdrop of the international security situation, it becomes ever more important and urgent to strengthen the multilateral system of arms control, disarmament and non­proliferation. 
This year marks the tenth anniversary of the entry into force of the Chemical Weapons Convention and the founding of the OPCW. Over the past ten years, the Convention has played an important role in prohibiting, eliminating and preventing proliferation of chemical weapons. Within the framework of the OPCW, dialogue and consultation represent the mainstream and mutual trust among States Parties keeps growing. The OPCW has truly become a platform that carries forward multilateralism, where joint efforts are made for peace. The achievements of the OPCW have been highlighted in the various commemorative events and activities organised by States Parties and the Technical Secretariat through this year. 
China has actively involved itself in the tenth anniversary commemorations. It has made a donation of 10,000 US dollars to the OPCW specifically for the commemorative activities, published booklets on Chinas implementation of the Convention, and has been keenly engaged inside the country in organising activities to further raise awareness of the Convention among implementation personnel, industry and the general public. In addition, China has sent representatives to events organised in places such as The Hague, New York, Berlin, Doha, and Algiers, thereby making a positive contribution to further disseminating the achievements of the Convention and enhancing exchanges among States.  
Looking forward, we believe that in any new situation, there should be continued unity between States Parties and the Technical Secretariat and concerted efforts in upholding the authority of the Convention and enhancing its universality and effective implementation. This is important for the safeguarding of global security and stability, and also a common responsibility for all parties.  
Mr Chairman, 
Now I would like to present some views of the Chinese delegation with regard to the agenda items. 
Enhanced universality and national implementation measures are important guarantee for the full and effective implementation of the Convention. We are pleased to note that with the joint efforts of Sates Parties and the Technical Secretariat, there have been significant achievements towards universality and positive progress in putting in place national implementation measures. China supports continued efforts to carry out, by way of cooperation and encouragement, the plans of action for universality and implementation measures.  
Speedy and complete destruction of chemical weapons is the central element and core objective of the Convention. China believes that whether all chemical weapons will be destroyed within the timeline prescribed by the Convention will bear on its prestige and credibility. The possessor States should, in strict accordance with the provisions of the Convention and the relevant decisions of the Conference, speed up their destruction and strive for an early completion. We support a greater role by the Technical Secretariat and the Council in overseeing the CW destruction. 
Industry verification is an important part of the Convention and a vital tool for non­proliferation. Since the entry into force of the Convention, resources for industry verification have always been allocated according to the principle of facility risk and geographical balance set out by the Convention. This principle has obtained vigorous support from States Parties and ensured the successful conduct of over 1,300 inspections. China maintains that any improvement of the industry verification regime should be effected within the framework of the above­mentioned principle and through learning from the experiences of past inspections, and that the views of States Parties should be taken into full consideration. 
Protection and assistance, and international cooperation in the field of chemistry are vital pillars of the Convention. Effective international cooperation will definitely help States Parties improve their CW protection capabilities, promote regular trade among States Parties, and enhance universality of the Convention. China calls on all States Parties to attach due importance to international cooperation, put in more funds and technologies, set out a practical and feasible medium- and long-term development plan, and undertake substantive exchanges and cooperation. 
China sets great store by the Second Review Conference to be convened next year. The Second Review Conference should be an occasion, in our view, to build on the practical experiences of past ten years, size up the advances of science and technology in chemistry, and actively explore ways and means to further facilitate full and effective implementation of the Convention. China will take part in its preparations with a positive and constructive attitude. 
Mr Chairman, 
China has all along supported the object and purpose of the Convention and fulfilled earnestly its obligations under the Convention. We have enacted and continuously refined our implementation laws and regulations, and have established implementation authorities at both central and local levels, which become an implementation system with effective management covering the whole country. China has submitted various declarations in a timely and accurate manner and has received over 140 inspections successfully, with18 inspections in the first ten months of this year. Attaching great importance to non-proliferation, we have developed an export control regulatory system in general conformity with the prevailing international practice, and our enforcement measures are stringent and effective. 
The Chinese government has actively facilitated the application of the Convention in the special administrative regions (SAR) of Hong Kong and Macao. Implementation efforts in the Hong Kong SAR are going on smoothly. Preparations for implementation in the Macao SAR are proceeding in an orderly manner. At this session of the Conference, the Chinese delegation also includes delegates from the Hong Kong SAR, who will report to States Parties, under the appropriate agenda item, on the status of implementation in the Hong Kong SAR. 
To date, the Japanese abandoned chemical weapons in China still pose a serious threat to the life, safety and ecological environment of the Chinese people. With efforts from both China and Japan, positive progress has been achieved towards the disposal of Japanese ACWs, but substantive destruction has yet to begin. We urge Japan to intensify its efforts and increase its input so as to complete the destruction of all Japanese ACWs at an earlier date. China will, as always, provide all necessary assistance. We appreciate the positive role the Technical Secretariat has played on this issue. As we approach the stage of substantive destruction, we welcome a deeper involvement of the Technical Secretariat in the relevant processes. 
Mr Chairman, 
Early and complete elimination of all weapons of mass destruction, including chemical weapons, conforms to the common interest of all peoples. China wishes to join efforts with others to make a positive contribution to building a harmonious world with lasting peace and common prosperity. 
Thank you, Mr Chairman. 
Statement 
H.E. Mr. J. E. Habibie 
Permanent Representative of the Republic of Indonesia 
to the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) 
At the 12th Conference of States Parties 
The Hague, 6 November 2007; 10.30 hrs. 

Mr. Chairman, 
Allow me to join other delegations in extending our sincere felicitations to you as the newly elected Chairman of the 12TH Session of the Conference of States Parties.  
We are confident that your able stewardship will contribute greatly to the success of our deliberations. Please be assured of my delegations full support and cooperation as we look forward to a favorable and productive session. 
We also would like to pay our tribute to your predecessor, Ambassador Alfonso Dastis of Spain and applaud him for his exceptional work and successful steering of the last conference. 
My delegation fully endorses and associates itself with the Statement delivered by His Exellency Mr. Oscar de los Reyes Ramos of Cuba on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement and China. 
I would like also to express our gratitude to the Director General, Mr. Rogelio Pfirter for the comprehensive report which shall facilitate our deliberation. 
Mr. Chairman,  
The number of states parties reached 182. My delegation warmly welcomes Barbados that has acceded to the Chemical Weapons Convention. This accession brings us closer to the universality of the Convention. 
Mr. Chairman,  
Indonesia has been continuously taking every effort in implementing its obligations, such as submitting declarations and receiving inspections, since the ascension to the Convention. 
To date, all Indonesias declared chemical facilities have been inspected and verified by the OPCW Team. The results of these inspections show that all reported activities remain consistent with the declaration. 
Indonesia has successfully concluded the Industry Outreach in February 2007 with the joint support from Japan and Australia. This outreach has provided a further opportunity for chemical industries to have in-depth knowledge on verification aspect. I would like to seize this opportunity once again to thank Japan and Australia for their assistance in organizing this outreach. 
Indonesia remains steadfast in her commitment in fulfilling the implementation of the Convention at the national level.  
1 

A passage of a draft law has been prioritized through the Parliament to anchor the Conventions stipulation within the national law. 
A series of meetings within the parliamentary committee involved in the drafting of national legislation has been convened during this year.   
A visit of Indonesian parliamentarians will be held in the near future for an in-depth discussion concerning the Chemical Weapons Convention, with the OPCW and the Netherlands National Authority. 
Mr. Chairman, 
It is imperative to strike a balance among the three pillars as stated in the Convention: the destruction of chemical weapons, the non-proliferation of chemical weapons and, the International Cooperation and Assistance.  
Out of these three pillars, for Indonesia, the destruction of chemical weapons remains the highest priority. Thus, we underscore that the complete, irreversible and verifiable destruction of chemical weapons and its relevant facilities at the targeted date is one of the core objectives set by the Convention. 
In this end, we welcome with satisfaction the completion of the destruction by Albania of its category 1 and 2 chemical weapons stockpile.  
We reiterate our call to the major Chemical Weapons possessor states to spearhead their efforts and adhere to their obligations stated in the Convention.  
Mr. Chairman,  
Indonesia takes note with satisfaction of the development that has been made in the implementation of Article VII on national implementation measures.  The number of states parties who have designated national authorities and those engaged in legislative processes is increasing.  
My delegation supports the continuation of constructive engagement and cooperative approach and provision of all possible assistance to states parties, upon their request, in the process of the implementation of the Plan of Action. 
Mr. Chairman, 
Another worthwhile issue to be considered and deserves attention is the implementation of Article XI on Economic and Technological Development.  
We reiterate that facilitation of the fullest possible exchange of chemicals, equipment and scientific and technological information for the purposes not prohibited under the Convention is essential. 
In acceding to the Convention, States Parties are bounded to prohibit the use, production and trade of chemical weapons, but not those for peaceful purposes as guaranteed by Article XI of the Convention. 
Full implementation of Article XI will be a positive impact on the enhancement of universality and the full implementation of the national implementation measures of the 
2 

Convention. My delegation reiterates and urges all States Parties to show a constructive approach and non-discriminatory implementation of all provisions of the Convention. 
For this endeavor, Indonesia expresses its high appreciation to Mr. Li Hong of China for his efforts in facilitating the consultation on Article XI. 
Mr. Chairman, 
In response to administrative and financial matters, my delegation notes with satisfaction the zero-growth budget proposal. We reiterate that a balance allocation in the regular budget for key programs and activities remain essential. Indonesia is of the opinion that the proper allocation for the International Cooperation and Assistance activities under annual program and budget needs to be increased as a reflection of the balance between three main pillars. 
Mr. Chairman, 
Another worthwhile issue to attend to is the current site selection methodology for Other Chemical Production Facilities inspection, which is evidently unsatisfactory. My delegation supports the resumption of the consultation of the Other Chemical Production Facilities site selection methodology that could be accepted by all States Parties. 
Finally, in submitting these attentions, Mr. Chairman, our earnest hopes that the issues presented today will be appropriately deliberated as I once again reiterate my delegations full support and cooperation in ensuring the success of this years Conference. 
 Thank you.

TWELFTH SESSION OF THE CONFERENCE OF STATE PARTIES 

TO THE CHEMICAL WEAPONS COVENTION 

STATEMENT BY 
H.E. AMBASSADOR SODOV ONON 
PERMANENT REPRESENTATIVE OF MONGOLIA 
TO THE ORGANISATION FOR THE 
PROHIBITION OF CHEMICAL WEAPONS 

THE HAGUE 
6 NOVEMBER 2007

(Please check against delivery) 
Mr. Chairman, 
On behalf of the delegation of Mongolia please allow me to congratulate you upon your election as the Chairman of the 12th Session of the Conference of the States Parties to the Chemical Weapons Convention. I am confident that under your considerable diplomatic skills and leadership the Conference will achieve its expected results. My delegation pledges its full support and cooperation during the Conference. 
Taking this opportunity I would like to thank the outgoing Chairman, His Excellency Ambassador Alfonso Dastis of Spain for his skillful chairmanship of the 11th session of the Conference and to wish him every success in his new endeavors. Our congratulations also go to the newly elected Bureau members of the current session. 
The delegation of Mongolia wishes to associate itself with the Joint Statement delivered yesterday by H.E.Ambassador Oscar de los Reyes Ramos of Cuba on behalf of the NAM CWC States Parties and China. 
Mr. Chairman, 
I wish to express my gratitude to the Director-General, Mr.Rogelio Pfirter for his comprehensive report, which shall greatly facilitate the deliberations of this Conference. 
The year 2007 is a special year indeed. It marks the 10th Anniversary of the entry into force of the CWC  the first international instrument on complete prohibition and total destruction of a whole category of weapons of mass destruction under the stringent verification regime. It has played a crucial role in banning and destroying chemical weapons and in preventing proliferation of such weapons. 
We are pleased to note that in 10 years since the entry into force of the CWC remarkable achievements have been made in promoting its universality. The impressive number of the membership of our organization which stands today at 182 clearly testifies the effective implementation of Plan of Action on Universality. My delegation warmly welcomes Barbados who has joined the OPCW since the 11th Conference of the State Parties. We wish to pay a special tribute to the Director-General for his untiring efforts to promote the universality of the Convention in all parts of the world as well as to the Technical Secretariat for its continuing efforts to assist the State Parties with their national implementation of the Convention. We should sustain our collective efforts to move ever closer to universality of 
 3 

adherence and to encourage all those countries that have not yet joined the Convention to do so in the nearest future. 
Mr.Chairman, 
The delegation of Mongolia notes with satisfaction that the progress has been made on the national implementation of the Convention under Article VII by the State Parties. With Turkmenistan, Montenegro and the Kingdom of Cambodia establishing CWC National Authorities in 2007 the number of the State Parties which have designated their National Authority has increased to 96 percent of the State Parties. However, much still needs to be accomplished in order to ensure full national implementation of all the Conventions obligations by the State Parties. 
Mongolia has always been committed to the goals of the Convention and honoured its obligations under the Convention. The establishment of the Mongolian National Authority in 1998 soon after Mongolias ratification of the Convention is a manifestation of the seriousness of its commitment to the objectives of the Convention.  Mongolia is currently undertaking appropriate measures aimed at the enactment of the relevant legislation to implement the Convention.  A revised Law on Toxic and Dangerous Chemicals was approved by the Parliament in May 2006. New provisions related to enhancement of control over the import and utilization of toxic and dangerous chemicals have been incorporated into the Law. National Council in charge of toxic and dangerous chemicals policy and coordination issues has been set up under the Prime Minister. In order to ensure the implementation of the revised Law the Government authorities are elaborating amendments to the existing rules and regulations. For example, by the Joint Order of the Ministers for Nature and Environment, Health and Emergency the Regulation on Storage, Transportation, Utilisation and Destruction of Toxic and Dangerous Chemicals has been recently approved. Another Regulation on Export, Import, Cross Boarder Transportation, Production and Trade of Toxic and Dangerous Chemicals has been drafted and is currently waiting for its approval. Moreover, the Government of Mongolia by its Resolution 95 of 2007 has approved the Revised List of Toxic and Dangerous Chemicals Prohibited and/or Limited for Utilisation. Taking this opportunity I would like to express my Governments high appreciation and gratitude to the Technical Secretariat for the support and assistance extended to Mongolias national capacity building to implement the obligations under the Convention. In this context I would like also to mention that Mongolia has recently submitted its request for assistance in capacity building of the Joint Centralized Laboratory of the State Specialised Inspection Agency under the OPCWs Laboratory Assistance Programme and to express our hope that this request will be considered positively.  
 4 

This year further steps have been made in achieving the ultimate goal of the OPCW, namely the realization of the world free of chemical weapons. Mongolia is pleased to note the recent increased level of destruction of chemical weapons by the possessor countries. We highly commend Albania for its achievements as the first State Party to complete the destruction of its entire chemical weapons stockpiles and we strongly believe that the possessor states will intensify efforts in order to meet their destruction deadlines under full verification. 
Mongolia strongly believes that  implementation of the CWC obligations in full  by all State Parties will make a significant contribution towards enhancing global security and stability, including fight against terrorism. 
Mr.Chairman, 
During this Conference we have to approve the draft Program and Budget for the next year and we are pleased to note with satisfaction that the draft Budget for 2008 is prepared for the third consecutive year on the basis of zero nominal growth. The International Cooperation and Assistance programmes are a core element in full and efficient implementation of the Convention and we welcome the overall increase of 3.6 percent earmarked for these programmes. Mongolia fully supports the emphasis of the Technical Secretariat on providing needed assistance to the State Parties who are still encounter challenges in implementing their national obligations under the Article VII of the CWC. 
In conclusion, the delegation of Mongolia expresses its appreciation for the progress that has been made under the leadership of Ambassador H.E. Lyn Parker of the United Kingdom in the preparatory work for the Second Review Conference and we are looking forward towards active participation in the Conference. 
I would like also to reiterate Mongolias commitment to the goals of the CWC as well as determination to continue our cooperation with other States Parties and the Technical Secretariat of the OPCW to ensure the effective implementation of the Convention. 
Thank you. 
Statement of Montenegro 
by Ambassador Milorad cepanovic, Deputy Minister of Foreign 
Affairs for Multilateral Relations 

Mr. Chairman, 
Mr. Director-General, 
Excellencies, 
Distinguished Delegates, 
Ladies and Gentleman, 

Allow me to address you on behalf of the Delegation of Montenegro and to warmly 
congratulate Chairman on his election. Also I want to join previous speakers in 
congratulating the Director-General and the staff of the Technical Secretariat of the 
Organisation for the Prohibition of the Chemical Weapons for their outstanding 
efforts and excellent work done in achieving the goals set out in the Chemical 
Weapons Convention. 

Also I want to welcome this occasion to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the 
entry into force of the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, 
Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on Their Destruction and to reaffirm 
our commitment to multilateralism and the object and purpose of the Convention. 
The significance of the latter lays down in the fact that it represents the first 
instrument which in a binding way addresses the issue of chemical weapons 
disarmament. Every day, as the existence of weapons of mass destruction continues 
to pose a serious threat to international peace and security, we become more aware 
of the importance of achieving the full and effective implementation of all provisions 
of the Chemical Weapons Convention. And in the realization of this task the role of 
the OPCW is indispensable. Beside of its mandate in the field of the international 
verification of compliance with the Convention OPCW is a forum for consultation 
and cooperation. 

I also want to emphasize that Montenegro as a country which recently signed the 
Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the European Union fully associates 
itself with the Statement of the EU and therefore I will highlight further on only some 
of the issues of particular importance for my country. 

Mr. Chairman, Distinguished Delegates, Ladies and Gentleman,  
As it is known, last year Montenegro became the youngest member of the United 
Nations. Also we speared no effort to renew our membership, now as an 
independent country, in the organizations and treaties that have as their goal 
enhancement of the international peace and security. At that end Montenegro 
become a Party to the Convention and as a consequence of this Montenegro 
responded to its obligations. We have constituted our National Authority and we 
have submitted the Initial Declaration. Montenegro, as a state that declared that it 
does not possess chemical weapons nor the facilities for its production, puts great 

effort in improvement of the national capacities to protect civilians against chemical attack, to enforce chemical weapons ban effectively, and to use chemistry peacefully. Also Montenegro has established a strategy on the development of the necessary legal framework that will be fully in accordance with the letter and the spirit of the Convention. 
Importance of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons and the significance of its work, its basic principles and goals, as well as successfully performed activities to achieving them, are widely recognized by the world community. In this context I would like to urge to all States that have not yet ratified or acceded to the Convention to do so without delay. 
I would like to conclude by reiterating our commitment to further contribute to the full and effective implementation of the Convention and to the functioning of the OPCW for the benefit of international peace and security, and for the preservation of humankind. Thank you very much! 
JOINT STATEMENT 

by H.E. Ambassador Oscar de los Reyes Ramos,  Permanent Representative of the Republic of Cuba  to the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons on behalf of the States Parties of the Non-Aligned Movement to the Chemical Weapons Convention and China, at the 12th  Session of the Conference of States Parties  of the OPCW. 
The Hague, 5th November 2007 (Please, check against delivery) 
Mr. Chairman,  
1. 
On behalf of the Members of the Non-Aligned Movement who are States Parties to the Chemical Weapons Convention and China allow me to congratulate you on your election as Chairman of this Conference.  We are happy to see that a representative of the NAM is presiding over this Conference. We are confident that with your knowledge, skills and experience you will be able to steer our work effectively and to a successful conclusion. We are ready to work and engage constructively with you and other States Parties with this purpose.  

2. 
I would also like to take this opportunity to thank the outgoing Chairman,  Ambassador Alfonso Dastis for his dedicated chairmanship of the Eleventh Conference of States Parties.  I wish to also congratulate the newly elected Bureau members of this 12th Session of the Conference. 

3. 
I wish to express our gratitude to the Director General, Mr. Rogelio Pfirter for the presentation of his report which shall greatly facilitate the deliberations of this Conference. 

Mr. Chairman, 

4.
 The Final Document, the Declaration on Purposes and Principles and the Role of the NAM in the Current International Circumstances, the Plan of Action of the NAM and other documents adopted by the Heads of State or Government of the Movement at the Havana Summit guide the Non-Aligned Movement in its activities.   

5.
 The NAM CWC States Parties and China reiterate their long-standing principled position for the achievement of complete disarmament, and for international peace and security, and reaffirm the decisions taken in this regard at the XIV Summit of the Movement, concerning the Chemical Weapons Convention. As the largest group of States Parties to the Convention, the NAM and China shall continue to be ever-inclusive and more representative in the consideration of various issues.  

6. 
In accordance with this, the NAM CWC States Parties and China wish to outline their position on important issues before the OPCW, with particular emphasis on the Agenda of this Twelfth Conference of States Parties to the Convention. 

Mr. Chairman,  

7.
 The existence of weapons of mass destruction continues to pose a serious threat to international peace and security.  The NAM CWC States Parties and China are committed to the full, effective and non­discriminatory implementation of the Convention and call for the prohibition and total elimination of all types of weapons of mass destruction in line with the first preambular paragraph of the Convention.   

8.
 The NAM CWC States Parties and China remain concerned about the current pace of destruction of chemical weapons. We stress that the total destruction of chemical weapons is one of the fundamental pillars of the Convention. In this regard, the compliance with the deadlines as set forth in the Convention constitutes an integral part of the undertakings by the Chemical Weapons Possessor States to destroy their chemical weapons.  

9. 
We strongly believe that it is imperative for major possessor states to fully commit to the preservation of the integrity and credibility of the CWC.  In this regard, we once again call upon them to strictly comply with their destruction obligations by 2012, as was decided by the Eleventh Conference of states Parties. 

Mr. Chairman, 

10.
 The NAM CWC States Parties and China attach great importance to the full implementation of Article XI of the Convention and stress the need for a balanced implementation of all provisions of the Convention. 

11.
 A decade of operation of the CWC has demonstrated that developing countries who are States Parties to the Convention have implemented their obligations in good faith. In this regard, the NAM CWC States Parties and China strongly believe that undue restrictions amongst States Parties on exchange of technology, materials and equipment for peaceful purposes are against both the letter and spirit of the Convention and affect its long term viability.  

12. 
It is fundamental to ensure the removal of and to prevent the imposition of any discriminatory restriction on access to materials, equipment and technology required by developing States Parties for their continued and peaceful development. In this context, the NAM CWC States Parties and China reiterate their call to developed countries to promote international cooperation through the transfer of technology, material and equipment for peaceful purposes in the chemical field and to remove all and any discriminatory restrictions.  

13.
 The NAM CWC States Parties and China strongly emphasize that it is time to fulfil the solemn undertakings given at the time of the Convention's adoption for removal of unwarranted restrictions, in the field of trade in chemicals, equipment and related technologies for peaceful purposes. 

14. 
We reiterate our conviction that facilitation of and participation in the fullest possible exchanges and enhanced international cooperation in the field of peaceful chemical activities, aimed at facilitating economic and social development, is a vital element in strengthening implementation of the Chemical Weapons Convention. We recall that the full, effective and non-discriminatory implementation of the provisions of international cooperation contribute to the universality of the Convention. 

15.
 The NAM CWC States Parties and China emphasize once again that the objectives of the Convention can be best achieved through multilaterally negotiated, universal, comprehensive and non- discriminatory agreements by all CWC States Parties. 

16.  
We wish to express our deepest appreciation to the facilitator on Article XI , Mr. Li Hong from China. We warmly commend him for the results of his work. We shall continue to actively and constructively participate and support these consultations on this fundamental pillar of the Convention. 

17. 
We encourage all States Parties to reinforce their commitment to the full implementation of Article XI through the adoption of a Plan of Action. This approach has resulted in significant achievements in the implementation of other provisions of the Convention. 

Mr. Chairman,    

18. 
We note with satisfaction that since the adoption of the Plan of Action on Universality, 27 countries have joined the Chemical Weapons Convention.  In this context, we wish to extend a warm welcome to Barbados to the family of States Parties to the Convention. The Organisation has now 182 States Parties, a figure that sets it closer to the goal of universal adherence to the Convention. 

19.
 The CWC is one of the very few disarmament multilateral treaties banning a whole category of weapons of mass destruction. Consequently, we believe that the effective contribution of the Convention to international and regional peace and security can be enhanced through the universality of the Convention.  

20.
 The NAM CWC States Parties and China wish to express their appreciation to the States Parties which have contributed to universality-related activities.  We likewise commend the Technical Secretariat for continuously intensifying its efforts to promote the universality of the Convention, which is fundamental for the attainment of its object and purpose. We urge all States that have still not joined the Convention to do so without further delay, particularly those States whose non-adherence has given rise to serious concern. 

21.
 The NAM CWC States Parties and China feel that the contribution to global anti-terrorism efforts in the context of the Chemical Weapons Convention can be best achieved by striving for full and effective implementation of all provisions of the Convention. In this regard, the promotion of the universality of the convention is of particular importance. 

Mr. Chairman,  

22.
 This 12th Session will be undertaking a review of the Plan of Action on the implementation of Article VII adopted at the Eighth Session of the CSP.  The significant progress achieved through constructive and cooperative approach since the adoption of the Plan of Action and DEC.16 at the 10th CSP, bears testimony to its success.  

23.
 In this framework we encourage all States Parties and the Technical Secretariat to continue this approach and devise appropriate solutions to overcome the practical difficulties and resource constraints encountered by individual States Parties in carrying out their national implementation measures. We are convinced that through the provision of meaningful assistance and technical support to States Parties, at their request, the objectives of the implementation of Article VII can be more effectively realised. 

Mr. Chairman, 

24.
 The NAM CWC States Parties and China reaffirm the importance of Article X of the Convention, and of the activities of the OPCW to maintain and develop a state of readiness to provide timely, adequate and effective assistance to Member States in situations of use or threat of use of Chemical Weapons against them.  We encourage all States Parties to fully implement their obligations under Article X including the enhancement of the voluntary fund for assistance. 

25.
 The NAM CWC States Parties and China stress the importance of the role of the OPCW in assisting States Parties concerning the needs of chemical weapons victims. In this regard, we look forward to consultations with a view to making recommendations by the Executive Council on appropriate ways and means to assist States Parties with regard to the victims of chemical weapons.  

26.
 On the issue of the establishment of an OPCW office in Africa, we recall the Decisions of the X and the XI sessions of the CSP and express our support to the endeavors of the African Group.  In this regard, the NAM CWC States Parties and China encourage the Technical Secretariat to provide all necessary support to States Parties in order to implement these decisions. 

27.
 On the subject of industry inspections, the NAM CWC States Parties and China underline that the Convention clearly sets out the hierarchy of risks posed by different chemicals to its object and purpose. The verification regime under Article VI must therefore correspond to the hierarchy of risks inherent to the respective category of chemicals. In this regard, we reiterate our call for continued consultations on the frequency of inspections and on the OCPF Site Selection Methodology.    

28.
 The NAM CWC States Parties and China support the  efforts of the Technical Secretariat to observe the implementation of the tenure policy. It is important that the tenure policy be strictly adhered to. It should enhance, among others, the opportunity of developing States Parties to be represented in the TS in a more geographical balanced manner. In this context, it is critical that the TS increase its efforts to enhance the presence of staff members from those States Parties, particularly at the professional level. 

Mr. Chairman,  

29.
 The Second Review Conference presents States Parties to the CWC an important opportunity to review the implementation of the operation of the Convention, which is a successful, multilaterally negotiated non-discriminatory, disarmament treaty.  

30.
 It is our view that the most important task before the Second Review Conference is to uphold the Convention in its entirety and reiterate the unreserved commitment of States Parties to the balanced implementation of all its aspects.  The focus should clearly be on a review of the implementation and not any reinterpretation of the Convention. 

31.  
The States Parties bear the responsibility for the implementation of the Convention and therefore should guide the process at all stages.  Their experience in the implementation of the Convention should provide the basis for the working of the Open Ended Working Group. 

32.
 NAM CWC States Parties and China attach high importance to the deliberations of the Open Ended Working Group and are committed and determined to make substantial contributions to the ongoing process. 

Finally, Mr. Chairman, 

33. 
It is the clear wish of the NAM CWC States Parties and China to renew the assurances of our fullest cooperation to you and to all other Member States in ensuring the success of this Conference. 


Thank you. 
Mr. Chairperson, 
Firstly let me echo other delegations in congratulating you on your election as Chairperson of the 12th Conference of States Parties. My delegation is confident that this conference under your leadership will be a success. 
I would also like to express my delegations appreciation and support to Director General R. Pfirter and his dedicated staff at the OPCW. 
Mr. Chairperson, 
The 10th Anniversary commemoration for the entry into force of the CWC at the UN General Assembly New York on the 27th September demonstrated to the whole international community the impressive results achieved by this Convention. Indeed, compared to other arms control treaties, the CWC is performing well. 
Yet, we must not be complacent. We must pursue our endeavours to further strengthen the CWC. That must be our main objective in our preparations for the Review Conference next year. 
Firstly, we must strive for full universality. This is a pre-condition to reach a world free of chemical weapons. Under the current Plan of Action, we have made important progress, but there are still important countries outside the CWC. We must continue efforts to get these countries on board. 
Secondly, it is imperative that existing stocks of chemical weapons are destroyed within agreed time limits. We commend Albania as the first possessor state to eliminate its stocks of chemical weapons.  
We encourage possessor states to do their utmost in meeting their destruction dead-lines. We have to bear in mind that the CWC is not only a non-proliferation, but also disarmament treaty. Together with the United Kingdom, Norway is engaged in a destruction cooperation programme with the Russian Federation. 
Thirdly, there is a need to further refine the verification and inspection mechanism of the Convention. The CWC is in the forefront compared with other arms control instruments. But we are confident that there is still room for improvements. Our focus should be on Other Chemical Production Facilities which are of high relevance to the Convention.  
Likewise the mechanism of challenge inspections should be used when needed. In this respect, my delegation is pleased that the Technical Secretariat maintains its readiness to conduct challenge inspections. Norway also appreciates the inspection exercise organised by the Netherlands. Fourthly, in accordance with Article VII, all States Parties must put in place and enforce national legislation to achieve full compliance with the Convention. While progress has been achieved under the current Action Plan, much remains to be done.  
We recognise that countries may need assistance in this respect. Norway has contributed to projects in Eastern Africa and Central Asia, and we are ready to continue our financial contributions for the promotion of the Convention. In addition, Norway has provided funding for regional workshops to facilitate implementation of Security Council Resolution 1540. 
Mr. Chairperson, 
We also need to make further progress with respect to Article X on assistance and protection against chemical weapons. It goes without saying that the use of chemical agents will have severe humanitarian implications. The international community must be able to respond swiftly if the worst were to occur. Norway has supported OPCW activities in this area and will continue to do so. 
Article XI on economic and technological development is an integral part of the CWC. We must continue and further enhance international cooperation in the field of chemical activities in conformity with the provisions of the CWC and to the benefit of sustainable development. 
We must ensure that the use of riot control agents conforms to the provisions of the Convention and does not have unacceptable humanitarian implications. We recognise that there are different views on this issue, but we should be able to explore ways to find a common ground. 
One main reason for the success of the CWC is that the Convention has been supported by the OPCW. We must ensure that this organisation and the Technical Secretariat are given the much needed political and financial support to fulfil its mandate.  
It is vital that all member States pay their assessed contribution in time, in full and without preconditions. We must also be ready to provide an adequate budget for the OPCW in order to fulfil the tasks given by the member States. 
Finally Mr. Chairperson, 
The Second Review Conference of the CWC next year provides us with a new opportunity to further strengthen the Convention. We must make good use of it. 
Thank you. 
Twelfth Session of the Conference of States Parties to the Chemical 
Weapons Convention 

Statement in the General Debate 
By 
Mr. Sibte Yahya Naqvi 

Ambassador and Permanent Representative of Pakistan to the OPCW 

The Hague, 05 November 2007 

(Please check against delivery) 
Mr. Chairman, 
Mr. Director General, 
Excellencies, Distinguished delegates, 
Ladies and Gentlemen! 

I wish at the outset to convey to you my warm felicitations on your election as Chairman of the 12th Conference of States Parties. With your notable diplomatic experience and skills and well-known contribution to the work of the OPCW as the Permanent Representative of Sudan, I am confident that you will guide the deliberations of this Conference to success. In this endeavour, please be assured of the full cooperation of my delegation. 
I would also like to thank your predecessor Ambassador Alfonso Dastis of Spain who performed his functions in the most effective and admirable manner. We wish him every success in his future endeavours. 
Mr. Chairman, 
Pakistan associates itself fully with the statement delivered by the distinguished Representative of Cuba on behalf of the States Parties belonging to the Non-aligned Movement and China.  
We express our appreciation to the Director General, Mr. Rogelio Pfirter for his comprehensive report covering the period since the last Conference. As his report amply indicates, the OPCW continues to make progress in realising its fundamental goals even as it faces some critical challenges especially in the context of completing the task of chemical disarmament as obligated in the Convention. 
I wish to express my appreciation to the Director General for his effective leadership of the Secretariat and for clearly enunciating both the achievements of the OPCW as well areas requiring our close and serious attention.  
This year the Organisation completed ten years of its operation. A number of important events connected with the commemoration of this landmark, highlighted to the world community the fact that the Convention was a unique disarmament instrument that comprehensively bans an entire category of weapons of mass destruction and provides for their elimination in a verifiable manner. 
The Foreign Minister of Pakistan in his message of felicitations recalled Pakistans firm commitment to the objectives of the Convention and its strong support for the work of the OPCW.  
We can take satisfaction from the fact that the Convention is now supported politically and legally by 182 countries of the world who are its States Parties. In fact, this is an area where progress has been most outstanding and it is our hope that those countries that have yet to join will also become States Parties before long. 
It is not an insignificant achievement to claim that virtually the entire international community is unanimous in supporting a chemical weapons free world. No other legal instrument relevant to weapons of mass destruction can claim this distinction which 
1 

underscores the principle that disarmament and non-proliferation are readily acceptable and successful through non-discriminatory instruments and policies and under conditions of strict international verification. 
In order to preserve the role of the Convention as a reliable and vital legal instrument, it is of crucial importance to respect the deadlines for the elimination of chemical weapons. At the last CSP which considered and adopted decisions concerning the extension of destruction deadlines, Pakistan took a constructive position and went along with requests concerning the extension of final deadlines which the Convention provides for as an exception.  
Those decisions must now be fully respected in word and in deed. The Convention was negotiated and adopted and deadlines for destruction established only after taking into account the quantities of chemical weapons that needed to be destroyed. The task represented a significant undertaking but not one that was beyond the capacities of possessor states. We, therefore, believe that by properly aligning national priorities and effort to the obligations under the Convention, possessor states should be in a position to comply with the Convention. We call upon the possessor states to redouble their efforts in meeting their final destruction deadlines. This is vital in order to preserve the viability and the sanctity of the Conventions provisions. 
At the Eleventh Session of the Conference, we had stressed the Secretariats competence and objectivity in carrying out its verification activities as sufficient grounds to assess progress concerning the obligations and commitments of possessor States.  I would like to reaffirm our position on this matter. 
Mr. Chairman, 
Domestic implementation of the Conventions obligations has been a subject of increasing attention for reasons of legitimate merit but also politically. We, however, take an objective and sympathetic view of this issue especially since most of the countries that have not been able to fulfil the requirements of the Convention are developing countries faced with competing challenges and lack of necessary resources. 
We believe that the progress that has been achieved since the adoption of the Action Plan on the implementation of Article VII obligations by the First Review Conference, is satisfactory. We also support the continuation of an approach that is cooperative and assists the countries concerned to build their national capacities to implement their obligations. We thank the Secretariat for the report it has submitted to this Conference. It contains encouraging signs of progress. We will support an appropriate decision to advance the objectives of the Action Plan in a cooperative and forward looking spirit. 
On its part Pakistan has put into place appropriate laws and regulations not just in the context of its CWC obligations but also more comprehensively covering other weapons of mass destruction. This is evident in our comprehensive reports to the UN Committee established pursuant to United Nations Security Council Resolution 1540 which has been followed by the recent establishment of  an export control authority which will be responsible for inter-agency coordination to enforce our comprehensive export control regulations. 
While Pakistan will continue to effectively implement its export control measures, we believe that international security is more than mere export controls or a surfeit of initiatives, arrangements, codes and strategies devised by restricted groupings.  We have, therefore, 
2 

called for a new international consensus on disarmament and non-proliferation that would take a comprehensive view of the urgent international priorities in the field and devise a strategy based on equity, balance and cooperation. Such a consensus should include multilaterally negotiated agreements on export controls as well as rules applicable to the promotion of peaceful uses of technology in areas directly relevant to the socio-economic development in developing countries. 
In this context, we must point out that while the OPCW represents a successful example of effective multilateralism, States Parties have a number of outstanding issues whose early resolution will ensure continuity of the cooperative and constructive atmosphere that characterises our work. 
As the NAM and China statement mentions, a decade of operation of the CWC has proven the good faith implementation of the CWC by the developing countries. It is time to fulfil the promises made at the time of the adoption of the Convention concerning promotion of legitimate trade and exchange of technology, materials and equipment for peaceful purposes. Pakistan supports the elaboration of steps that could be included in An Action Plan relating to the implementation of Article XI of the Convention. 
Mr. Chairman, 
Pakistan fully supports the transparency and confidence building provisions of the Convention that relate to verification of the civilian chemical industry.  We have successfully and ungrudgingly received inspections at more than half of the OCPF facilities in Pakistan. Others with much larger number of such facilities have received a much smaller number of inspections as a ratio of the number of facilities inspectable on their territories. 
We will continue to fulfil our obligations in good faith and in a spirit of strengthening the Convention. 
We have noted the decision taken by the Director General to introduce a change in the site selection method in order to correct some of the imbalance that I have mentioned. We support this measure and are also prepared to continue to work with other States Parties towards an appropriate decision that would provide a more enduring basis to the site selection methodology. We would, however, stress that the Convention in Part IX of the Verification Annex contains an ambiguous provision which has proven difficult to interpret and implement. Therefore, some have argued for the inclusion of elements in the site selection formula that would be politically contentious and will not lead to consensus. We, therefore, believe that work on this matter will be productive only if the weighting factors to be eventually agreed are based on objective and politically neutral considerations.   
On the related matter of increasing the overall numbers of inspections of OCPF plant sites, we need to proceed with due care and deliberation keeping full view of the original intent reflected in the Convention which establishes an hierarchy of threats that different types of facilities pose to the object and purpose of the Convention.

Mr. Chairman, 
We have taken note with satisfaction that the Director Generals programme for cooperation with Africa has been supported by the African Group. We hope this programme and the experience gained from it will enable a better informed decision on the proposal for the establishment of an OPCW office in Africa. 
We in Pakistan are very proud of our Foreign Service programme which every year offers training opportunities to young diplomats from many countries including our friends from Africa. A unique feature of this programme is the module that it receives from the Secretariat explaining to the participants the salient features of the CWC and the work of the OPCW. Indeed some foreign participants have returned to their capitals and taken up work relating to the OPCW. We hope this year also, the Secretariat will be able to offer presentations at the Academy for the benefit of nearly 50 young diplomats belonging to over 30 nations. 
In conclusion, I would once again reaffirm Pakistans strong support for the goals of the Convention and the work of the OPCW. We share the satisfaction that this work has received recognition and support from the international community as witnessed during a variety of events that were held this year to commemorate the 10th anniversary of the entry into force of the Convention. The Director General and staff at the Secretariat deserve our commendation for the effective manner in which they have projected the accomplishments of multilateralism as evident at the OPCW.   
My delegation approaches the 12th Conference in this positive spirit and we will work actively and constructively for its success.  
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

Statement by H.E. Mr. Janusz Stanczyk 
Permanent Representative of the Republic of Poland  
to the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons 

Twelfth Session of the Conference of States Parties 

The Hague, 5-9 November 2007 

Mr. Chairman,  
Allow me to congratulate you, Mr. Abuelgasim Abdelwahid Shiekh Idris, Ambassador of Sudan, with the assumption of the chair of this session. I am convinced that your experience will guide us successfully throughout this Conference. I would also like to assure you of the co-operation of my Delegation. 
Before continuing my statement, I wish to say that the statement delivered by the distinguished Ambassador of Portugal on behalf of the EU and aligning countries also fully reflects position of Poland. 
Mr. Chairman, Director General, Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,  
Poland has conducted several events devoted to the Tenth Anniversary of the entry into force of the Chemical Weapons Convention, both at the national and international levels. In this context, I wish to mention the workshop on the CWC National Implementation, held in April 2007 in Krynica. This seminar was organized with the assistance of the OPCW. 
A most important event took place on 27 September this year in the United Nations headquarters in New York  the High-Level Meeting on the occasion of the Tenth Anniversary of the Entry into Force of the Chemical Weapons Convention. The Meeting, jointly organised by Poland, as the sole sponsor of the United Nations General Assembly Resolution on the CWC implementation, and the Netherlands, as the Host Country of the OPCW, was convened upon the initiative of the OPCW Director General. The Meeting was co-chaired by H.E. Mrs Anna E. Fotyga, Minister of Foreign Affairs of Poland, and H.E. Mr. Maxime Verhagen, Foreign Minister of the Netherlands. The Meeting was attended by almost 40 foreign ministers and other senior representatives from 123 UN Member States (among them 3 States not Parties to the CWC), the relevant international and non-governmental organisations. Both United Nations Secretary General Mr. Ban Ki-moon and the OPCW Director General Mr. Rogelio Pfirter delivered speeches. 
The Meeting was the most important event in the field of disarmament and non-proliferation during the 62nd session of the United Nations General Assembly. It showed a great interest of the international community to strengthen the norms and activities aimed at stemming the danger of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. In the concluding Statement from the Meeting (enclosed) we commemorated all victims of chemical weapons, reaffirmed our commitment to multilateralism and to the object and purpose of the Convention. We also confirmed that the full implementation and universal adherence to the Convention are fundamental to the achievement of its objective and purpose. The Meeting served as an occasion to call upon all States that have not yet joined the CWC to do so without delay and was a good example of building synergies between the international organisations involved in disarmament and non-proliferation. 
Mr. Chairman,  
I would like to take this opportunity to thank all parties involved in the preparations to the Meeting. We are particularly thankful to the OPCW Director General, Ambassador Rogelio Pfirter, and the staff of the OPCW Technical Secretariat, for their active support and assistance extended during several months of preparations to the Meeting. Our special thanks go to the Dutch Colleagues, working both here in The Hague and in New York, for their professionalism, openness, co-operation and full commitment to the success of the Meeting. Last but not least, we would like to thank all countries involved for working together in the spirit of compromise and understanding.    
Let me quote the Polish Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mrs. Anna Fotyga, who said in New York that we hope that the Chemical Weapons Convention and the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons  as successful examples of multilateralism  will serve as good examples for other areas of disarmament and non-proliferation. Indeed, we should work hard during this CSP and upcoming Second Review Conference, to set again a best example of compromise and effectiveness. 
Mr. Chairman,  
Poland, as a member of the United Nations and the European Union, is actively involved in international efforts to promote international peace and security. Disarmament and non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction belong to the areas of particular interest for Poland. We attach great importance to the full implementation of the Chemical Weapons Convention and to the work and vital role played by the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. Every year my country, as a sole sponsor, introduces the draft Resolution of the UN General Assembly on the Implementation of the Convention. We hope that this year the Resolution, which serves as an important tool to promote the universality and effective national implementation of the CWC, will be approved without a vote in the General Assembly once again. 
Mr. Chairman,  
In conclusion allow me to reiterate our commitment to the success of the Twelfth Session of the Conference of States Parties.  
Thank you for your attention. 
STATEMENT  
of the High-Level Meeting 
on the Tenth Anniversary of the Entry into Force 
of the Chemical Weapons Convention 

New York, United Nations, 27 September 2007 

On the occasion of the Tenth Anniversary of the Entry into Force of the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on Their Destruction, we wish to remember all victims of chemical weapons and to reaffirm our commitment to multilateralism and the object and purpose of the Convention.  
The Convention and its implementation contribute to enhancing international peace and security. We emphasize that its full, universal, effective and non-discriminatory implementation will contribute further to that purpose by excluding completely, for the sake of all humankind, the possibility of the use of chemical weapons. 
The universality of the Convention is fundamental to the achievement of its objective and purpose. We acknowledge progress made on the universality of the Convention, and call upon all States that have not yet done so, to become parties to the Convention without further delay. 
We stress the obligations of the possessor States Parties to the Convention to destroy their chemical weapons in accordance with the provisions of the Convention, and within the deadlines as extended by the Conference of States Parties. 
We reaffirm the importance of the provisions of the Convention relating to the economic and technological development of States Parties and recall that the full, effective and non­discriminatory implementation of those provisions contributes to universality, and also reaffirm the undertaking of the States Parties to foster international cooperation for peaceful purposes in the field of chemical activities of the States Parties and the importance of that cooperation and its contribution to the promotion of the Convention as a whole. We highlight that full implementation is vital for the object and purpose of the Convention as a whole.   
We emphasize that States Parties have the right, as provided by the Convention, to request and to receive timely, adequate and efficient assistance and protection against the use or threat of use of chemical weapons. 
We reaffirm that the full and effective implementation of all provisions of the Convention constitutes in itself an important contribution to the efforts of the international community in the global fight against terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. 
We appreciate the ongoing work of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons to achieve the objectives and purpose of the Convention, to ensure the full implementation of its provisions, including those for international verification of compliance with it, and to provide a forum for consultation and cooperation among States parties, and also note with appreciation the substantial contribution of the Technical Secretariat and the Director General to the continued development and success of the Organization. 
We welcome all the national and international events conducted throughout 2007 devoted to the Tenth Anniversary of the Entry into Force of the Convention. They provided a special occasion to renew our commitment to multilateralism and to the object and purpose of the Convention. 
We also welcome the unveiling in The Hague, on 9 May 2007, of the Permanent Memorial to All Victims of Chemical Weapons as a testimony of the international communitys commitment to peace and hope for the future. 
TWELFTH SESSION OF THE CONFERENCE OF THE STATES PARTIES TO THE CHEMICAL WEAPONS CONVENTION 
The Hague, 5-9 November 2007 Check against delivery 
STATEMENT 
by Ambassador Bratislav Djordjevic, 
Head of the National Authority of the Republic of Serbia  
for the Implementation of the Chemical Weapons Convention, 
made in the General debate on 6 November 2007 

Mr. Chairman, 
Mr. Director-General, 
Excellencies, 
Ladies and Gentlemen, 

On behalf of the delegation of Serbia, I would like to congratulate you, Mr. Chairman, on 
your unanimous election to this high office and the assumption of your responsible duties. Let 
me assure you that you can count on my delegations full cooperation and support. 

Our appreciation goes also to Ambassador Alfonso Dastis of Spain, who has successfully 
guided us through the Eleventh session of the Conference. 

May I also congratulate the Director-General of the OPCW, Ambassador Rogelio Pfirter, for 
his comprehensive Report on the work of the Organization that has laid down a very good 
basis for our deliberations.We share his views and support his untiring efforts aimed at 
making the Organization more effective and fully universal. 

My delegation would also like to associate itself with the statement made by Portugal, on 
behalf of the EU. 

Mr. Chairman, 

This year, we have been observing the tenth anniversary of the Chemical Weapons 
Convention. The unveiling of the Permanent Memorial to All Victims of Chemical Weapons 
on 9 May in The Hague and the High-Level Meeting held during the UN General Assembly 
in New York on 27 September 2007, afforded all of us the opportunity to reaffirm our 
commitment to the purposes and objectives of the Convention, its historic importance and 
contribution to the creation of a more secure general environment for all. Even more so, in 
view of the need for an energetic and coordinated response to the new challenges to 
international security, primarily posed by terrorism. 

There is no doubt that during the past ten years, the OPCW and its member States achieved significant results in the implementation of the Convention. The Organization has become almost fully universal; close cooperation between the National Authorities and the OPCW has developed; the States Parties have enacted national legislation and taken concrete steps to fully implement the Convention. The necessary conditions have been created for the elimination of chemical weapons, and we have already seen concrete results, i.e. with the recent successful completion of the process of the destruction in Albania, our region has become free of chemical weapons. We hope that the other possessor States will follow suit within the agreed time-table. 
Despite all the results that have been achieved, it can be concluded that much still remains to be done. We should fully use the coming months to prepare for the Second Special Session of the Conference of the States Parties to Review the Operation of the Chemical Weapons Convention (RC-2), to be held from 4-18 April 2008 in The Hague. This Conference cannot be successful if we only take stock of our past achievements and results. It is certainly necessary to analyze  the Organizations performance so far, but what is essential is to offer a vision for the next five years and beyond, and agree on a set of concrete steps which would increase its effectiveness in the implementation of the Convention, in view of the new challenges. The chemical disarmament, non-proliferation, international cooperation and assistance and the ability for outreach, should enable the Organization to reach every part of the world, thus ensuring both the full respect of the Conventions provisions and the benefits of the chemical industry under the Convention. 
Mr. Chairman, 
The Republic of Serbia, as an active OPCW member, is prepared to fully participate in these activities. The National Authority has been actively working with our respective ministries and the Parliament to revise the relevant laws and regulations currently in force and to adopt new ones. A new Draft law on the implementation of the Convention has finally been submitted to the Parliament and its adoption is anticipated by the end of this year. Another legal instrument relevant to the export-import of chemicals, that is the Law on Foreign Trade of Arms, Military Equipment and Dual-Use Goods adopted in 2005, is currently being revised to bring it even more in line with the existing EU standards. The Parliament will also start deliberations regarding the new Draft law on the control of chemicals. The Government will soon approve the text of the Agreement on the Privileges and Immunities of the OPCW. 
In the course of this year, two OPCW inspections were successfully carried out in Serbia  one pertaining to Schedule 1, and the other regarding the OPCF. 
In addition to fulfilling its regular obligations towards the OPCW, Serbia since 2004, has been rendering its significant support to the Organization and its member States by organizing international courses on assistance and protection against chemical weapons. So far, 65 representatives from 46 countries have participated in these courses at our NBCD Training Center in Krusevac, where they acquired basic knowledge and skills in this field.  
This year has been particularly successful regarding the cooperation with the OPCW and its member States. In the framework of our contribution to the capacity-building project for the countries of North Africa, in June, basic and advanced courses in assistance and protection against chemical weapons were conducted for 20 experts from Algeria, Libya, Morocco and Tunisia. At the request of the OPCW Inspectorate Division, three one-week training courses with live agents were conducted for 42 OPCW inspectors, in June and July. In the meantime, it has been agreed that new trainings for the OPCW inspectors be held at our Centre in Krusevac, in December 2007 and February 2008. 
We have recently signed an arrangement with the OPCW Technical Secretariat on the internship of personnel from the OPCW Inspectorate at the National Poison Control Centre in Belgrade, as an additional step in the direction to making full use of our expertise and capabilities in this field. 
At the South East Europe Clearing House Initiative Meeting, held in Dubrovnik, Croatia, in September 2007, the countries from the region have supported the establishment of a Regional centre for education and training of their personnel in the field of NBCD, in Serbia. At the meeting of Stabilization and Association Process countries of our region, devoted to the implementation of the Convention, held in Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina, from 18-19 October 2007, it was decided to step up regional cooperation in respect of border control regarding import-export and transfer of chemicals under the Convention. 
Mr. Chairman, Distinguished Delegates, 
We are gratified that, by offering courses, training and our expertise, in cooperation with the OPCW, we are, in fact, making a tangible contribution towards the fulfillment of the objectives and purposes of the Convention. 
Building upon the results achieved, Serbia would like to expand and enhance its cooperation with the OPCW and its member States, not only in the field of assistance and protection against chemical weapons and training of inspectors, but also in other areas that may be of interest to OPCW and States Parties. 
In conclusion, we stand ready to extend our cooperation and join the activities on bilateral, regional and multilateral levels. 
I thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
STATEMENT BY SINGAPORE AT THE  12TH CONFERENCE OF STATES PARTIES  5 - 9 November 2007 
Mr Chairman 
The Director-General of OPCW 
Distinguished delegates 
Ladies and Gentlemen 
Mr Chairman 
On behalf of my delegation, I wish to express our congratulations to you on assuming the Chairmanship of the Conference of States Parties, I am confident that your astute diplomatic skills will steer us toward a successful outcome and I pledge the full support of my delegation to you. I would also like to express our appreciation to H.E Ambassador Alfonso Dastis, for his excellent work at the 11th Conference of States Parties. 
I would also like to thank the Director-General, H.E Ambassador Rogelio Pfirter, for his excellent stewardship of the Technical Secretariat and his detailed report which will set the stage for our discussions this week. 
Mr Chairman 
This year marks the 10th Anniversary of the Chemical Weapons Convention. Singapore would like to commend the OPCWs excellent work and its relentless efforts in promoting the Conventions universality. Since the Convention entered into force in 1997, membership has grown steadily to a total of 182 States Parties today. Singapore warmly welcomes the entry of Barbados as the 182nd State Party to the Convention. The continual rise in membership shows the increasingly widespread acceptance of the Convention. More importantly, it reflects the commitment States Parties share towards the global objective of eradicating chemical weapons. We would like to commend Albania on its completion of the destruction of its Categories 1 and 2 chemical weapons stockpile and also on the relentless efforts by other  States Parties in the destruction of their chemical weapons stockpiles.  
Singapore strongly believes that states need to join together at the global and regional front to curb illicit activities related to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. In this respect, the Convention plays a crucial role in the disarmament and non­proliferation of weapons of mass destruction in making the world a more secure place.  
Mr Chairman 
Singapore is fully committed to international efforts to eliminate Chemical Weapons. Singapores national legislation to effectively implement the CWC was passed by the Parliament in May 2000. Through this Act, Singapore has incorporated the requirements of the Convention into our legal system. An amendment to the Bill was recently passed in Parliament and would take effect before the end of the year, to incorporate concentration limits of specified controlled chemicals to be in line with the Conventions verification and declaration requirements. 
Since 1 Jan 2003, Singapore has enacted the Strategic Goods (Control) Act to complement the Chemical Weapons (Prohibition) Act as part of our efforts to enhance existing controls on chemical weapons precursors and other goods that could contribute to the development of weapons of mass destruction and their delivery systems. With effect from 1 January next year, this Strategic Goods (Control) Act will be strengthened to impose controls on additional chemical weapons precursors and dual-use equipment, similar to those listed under the Australia Group.  
The key component of the Chemical Weapons Convention is through its comprehensive verification regime. Singapore fully supports this verification regime. To date, since our ratification in 1997, Singapore has acknowledged and facilitated a total of 16 OPCW inspections at our Schedule 1 Facility for Protective Purposes, Schedule 3 and Discrete Organic Chemical Production Facilities.  
In addition to Singapores support to the verification regime, Singapore has also dutifully made annual declarations of past and anticipated activities for Scheduled Chemicals and DOCs, as required under the Convention. Singapore had recently successfully completed and submitted its Annual Declaration for Anticipated Activities in August and September this year. 
Mr Chairman 
Beyond our obligations to the Chemical Weapons Convention, Singapore believes in facilitating the work of OPCW in areas whereby we can make a positive contribution. In this regard, Singapore had pledged to provide technical assistance to the OPCW under Article X of the Convention, in the form of equipment, facilities and analytical services to support the verification regime of the Convention. Singapores chemical verification laboratory, the Defence Science Organisation (DSO) National Laboratories, strives to contribute positively and significantly to relevant verification tasks under the Convention. 
Singapores chemical verification laboratory in DSO has been actively involved in a number of OPCW initiatives. It has also maintained its high standards as an OPCW designated laboratory by performing successfully in the Twenty-First OPCW Proficiency Test.  
Singapore also supports the OPCW in promoting universality of the Convention. Back in 2003, Singapore and the OPCW jointly organized the First Regional Meeting of the National Authorities of States Parties in Asia. Today, this meeting has evolved into a network of responsible states and national authorities, who gather annually to share their views and perspectives on implementation issues. 
Mr Chairman 
Singapore has also participated in regional workshops and meetings organized by OPCW and States Parties, which are aimed at promoting the universal implementation of the Convention. Singapore continues to look forward to such opportunities and platforms for exchanging of views to promote effective implementation of the Convention. 
Provided under Article XI of the Convention, the regime encourages international cooperation and exchange of scientific and technical information in the field of chemistry for peaceful purposes. With recent scientific and technological advances, especially in the convergence of chemistry and biology and in nanotechnology, it is important that we keep abreast of such advancements to ensure that the Convention, especially the verification regime, can be implemented effectively.  
In line with this, Singapore has been organizing the Singapore International Symposium for Protection Against Toxic Substances (SISPAT) on a biennial basis. The most recent Fifth SISPAT symposium was held from 27 November to 1 December 2006 in Singapore, in conjunction with the 1st International Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Explosives Operations Conference (ICOC).  The aim of the symposium was to encourage cross-fertilisation of ideas and development of novel solutions from both defence and non-defence partners to neutralize such threats. We are honoured that H.E. Ambassador Rogelio Pfirter was able to officiate the opening of this symposium with his keynote speech. 
A total of 450 Delegates from over 35 countries participated in that symposium. Participants deliberated on emerging threats, agent fate and detection modeling, operations technology, medical counter-measures, decontamination, homeland security, mass casualty management and protection against all unconventional threats. 
Finally, Mr Chairman 
It is imperative that States Parties of the Convention stay committed to support the goals of the Convention, which is to achieve the ultimate goal of a world free of chemical weapons. Singapore will continue in that commitment and contribution towards the effective implementation of the Convention. I wish you and all distinguished delegations present today, a successful Conference.  
Thank you.

SOUTH AFRICAN PERMANENT REPRESENTATIVE TO THE 
OPCW 

GENERAL DEBATE OF THE 12TH SESSION OF THE 
CONFERENCE OF STATES PARTIES TO THE 
CHEMICAL WEAPONS CONVENTION 

6 NOVEMBER 2007 

Check against delivery 
Mr. Chairperson, 
The South African delegation would like to congratulate you on your election as Chairperson of the 12th session of the Conference of States Parties to the Chemical Weapons Convention. I would like to assure you of our full cooperation and support for your efforts to guide this sessions work to a successful conclusion. 
My delegation would also like to acknowledge and thank the outgoing chairperson, Ambassador Alfonso Dastis, for his leadership and the outstanding manner in which he guided the work of the 11th session of the Conference of States Parties. 
The South African delegation would like to express its appreciation to the Director-General for his statement, which provides a clear and comprehensive overview of the status of the Convention and the Organisation.  
Mr. Chairperson, 
The South African delegation associates itself with the statement delivered on behalf of the Non-aligned Movement and China by the representative of Cuba, as well as with the statement delivered on behalf of the African Group.  
The 12th session of the Conference has a number of important decisions to consider and is also the last Conference of States Parties to take place before the second Review Conference of the Convention.  
On the issue of Article VII, my delegation wishes to reiterate South Africas commitment to the full implementation of this article, which is illustrated by the fact that all our national implementing legislation and administrative measures are in place.  In this regard we also welcome the progress that has been made by States Parties, particularly on the African Continent. However, we wish to highlight the importance of providing the necessary assistance to States Parties that are experiencing problems with instituting national implementation measures. 
My delegation wishes to emphasise the importance of the full implementation of Article XI. We look forward to the adoption of a decision by the Conference which will provide for the development of concrete measures, including a possible Plan of Action on the full implementation of this Article.  In this regard we support intensive consultations that would enable the Executive Council to recommend a framework of implementation to CSP13. 
Mr. Chairperson,

Check against delivery 
No other process, institution or mechanism in the field of disarmament and non­proliferation has come close to realising, in a similar manner to this Convention, the destruction and prohibition of an entire category of weapons of mass destruction. For this to happen, however, all destruction activities should be completed within the deadlines determined by the Convention.  This will not only place the Convention and OPCWs continuing successful operations beyond question, but will also illustrate all Member States continued commitment to the disarmament and non-proliferation ideals of the Convention.  We therefore call on all States Parties who possess chemical weapons to actively continue with their destruction programmes and to ensure that all chemical weapons stockpiles are destroyed by the agreed deadlines. 
We would like to commend the Director-General and the Technical Secretariat for the vigor with which they are pursuing responsible budgetary processes in the organisation. My delegation, however, believes continuous zero-nominal growth and especially negative growth budgets, is not in the best interest of the Organisation. This is particularly in view of the fact that the OPCW still has much to do in terms of pending destruction activities as well as providing assistance to States Parties. 
Mr. Chairperson, 
On the issue of an OPCW Office in Africa, we support the call for the speedy appointment of a new facilitator and the reactivation of the working group on this issue. 
My delegation welcomes the Programme for Africa, which has been developed by the Technical Secretariat on the initiative of the Director-General, and which we regard as a concrete step forward to assist African States Parties in the implementation of the Convention as well as to benefit from it. We look forward to the Programmes implementation, as soon as possible, keeping in mind the suggestions and inputs, which African States Parties have made. It is also important to continuously refine and adjust the Programme so that it adequately addresses the needs of African States Parties. 
Furthermore, my delegation would like to reiterate the importance it attaches to the principle of equitable geographical representation in terms of the recruitment of personnel for the Technical Secretariat as well as ensuring a favourable gender balance. 
We appeal to the Director-General to pay specific attention to the appointment of African nationals in the Technical Secretariat in a balanced and representative manner. A significant number of States Parties is from the African Region and we would urge the Director-General to take special measures to ensure that this reality is reflected in the composition of the Technical Secretariat, not only in numbers but also in terms of seniority.

Mr. Chairperson, 
South Africa is looking forward to co-operating with other States Parties to ensure that the 2nd Review Conference of the Convention amounts to a thorough review of the Convention and plots the way for a constructive future for the Convention. In this regard it is our view, that, as we approach the 2nd Review Conference of the CWC and the deadline for the destruction of all chemical weapons by 2012, States Parties will increasingly have to consider ways in which the Convention could contribute to the fostering of economic and technological development in the chemical industries of developing States Parties. It is important that we, as States Parties envisage a future for the Convention that is not only based on security-related issues, but also recognises in a more comprehensive manner, the interests of developing States Parties to the Convention. 
During the Workshop of States Parties of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) hosted by South African during July 2007, the South African Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, Ms Sue van der Merwe stated that South Africa sees non-proliferation within the context of an all encompassing development process, which is part of our foreign policy agenda. She further noted that, Towards this end we have committed ourselves to promoting and supporting the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, with the goal of international peace, stability and security, whilst at the same time also ensuring that control measures do not become means whereby developing countries are denied access to advanced technologies required for their own development. The challenge we are all faced with is to balance genuine security concerns with development objectives, within the context of non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. 
In our view this is exactly the challenge that will be facing States Parties at the 2nd Review Conference. 
Mr. Chairperson, 
The South African delegation looks forward to the successful consideration and conclusion of the programme of work of this 12th session under your able leadership. 
Thank you

Statement by Ambassador Selahattin Alpar Permanent Representative of the Republic of Turkey to the OPCW 
Delivered on 05.11.2007 
Twelfth Conference of the State Parties to the  
Chemical Weapons Convention 

The Hague, 5-9 November 2007 

STATEMENT BY THE REPUBLIC OF TURKEY 
(The Twelfth Conference of State Parties, 5-9 November 2007, The Hague) 
Mr. Chairman,  Mr. Director-General, Special Representative of the Secretary General of the UN, Distinguished Delegates, 
At the outset I would like to extend my Delegations compliments to the Ambassador of Sudan, HE Abdulqasim Idris for his election to the Chairmanship of the Twelfth Conference of State Parties. We are of the firm belief that his well respected diplomatic skills as well as the experience and dedication of the Director General of the OPCW Ambassador Rogelio Pfirter will help to ensure the success of this conference. They will have the full cooperation and support of the Turkish Delegation.  
Our gratitude goes to the Ambassador of Spain, HE Alfons Dastis who chaired the eleventh Session. 
Mr. Chairman, 
Even though we have aligned ourselves with the EU Statement read by the Ambassador of Portugal, HE Júlio Mascarenhas, I would like to touch upon several issues which are, I believe, important for this body and at the same time of special interest to my country.   
This year we have marked the 10th anniversary of the entry into force of the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC). This Conference is specifically important for taking stock of the implementation of the core objective of the Convention, namely the elimination of all chemical weapons and their production facilities with a view to achieving the ultimate goal of complete disarmament through strict and effective control of this process. In that regard, Albania deserves appreciation, as the first possessor State Party to completely eliminate its declared chemical weapons stockpile under the Chemical Weapons Convention. We are of the opinion that such a constructive interaction among countries contributes to the reduction of the threats to global security and promote the goals of international peace. 
We are confident that other possessor states will no doubt enhance their efforts to meet their obligations stemming from the Convention to achieve complete and irreversible destruction of their chemical weapons within the deadlines set 
1 

by the Convention. In any case, final deadlines set by the Convention as the completion of the destruction of the chemical weapons should not be exceeded. 
The Second Review Conference to be held on 7-18 April 2008 to review the operation of the Convention will be an important occasion, as it had been in the case in the First Review Conference. We consider the 2nd Review Conference as an instrumental tool for devising ourselves to the needs of effective, robust and timely implementation of the Chemical Weapons Convention. We urge all delegations to work together in a constructive manner to find ways and means to fill the implementation gaps. Thus, the Review Conference will give us yet another opportunity to emphasize and demonstrate the importance of the Convention and contribute to promote international peace and security. 
Furthermore, the Conference itself should not be seen as a remedy to all implementation issues which needs to be solved. We know that it is not always easy to find a compromise to the satisfaction of the all the delegations, but we are confident that when the delegations display genuine willingness we can overcome all the difficulties. Success story of the Chemical Weapons Convention in the last 10 years is the clear indication of the existence of this willingness. With this understanding we will continue to support the ongoing work in the relevant group for the preparation of the Review Conference and appreciate the work of Ambassador Lyn Parker.  
In this connection, I would also like to extend my compliments to the excellent job that has been done by the Technical Secretariat under the able leadership of the Director General of the OPCW. 
Universality and national implementation of the Convention remains one of the challenges that we still need to face. Although States Parties to the Convention have considerably increased and reached a total of 182, we should keep the momentum until all the states become party to the Convention. In this connection I would like to compliment efforts to promote the universality of the Chemical Weapons Convention among States in the Mediterranean Basin, the Middle East, and neighboring regions. 
I would like to take this opportunity to stress the importance of striving not just for a Convention that is universal, but for a Convention that is universally implemented. Effective national implementation of the obligations of the Convention plays an indispensable role for our common security. It is also a sine qua non for the success of the CWC. In this context, a robust verification regime plays a key role. In that regard, as we come closer to the deadline for the completion of the destruction of chemical weapons stockpiles, inspection of other chemical production facilities deserves much more attention.  
2 

At the same time, assistance and protection against chemical weapons continues to be an important topic.  It is crucial to give an effective and timely response in case of use of chemical weapons. Therefore, we attach importance to ongoing endeavors to achieve this goal. 
Mr. Chairman, 
I would like to touch upon the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy, adopted by the General Assembly on the 8th of September 2006 which is of importance to States Parties and particularly to Turkey and many other States who have encountered terrorist attacks. This resolution together with the Plan of Action is a unique global instrument that will enhance national, regional and international efforts to counter terrorism. The resolution encourages the International Atomic Energy Agency and the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons to continue their efforts, within their respective mandates, in helping States to built capacity to prevent terrorists from accessing nuclear, chemical or radiological materials, to ensure security at related facilities, and to respond effectively in the event of an attack using such materials.  
The resolution is particularly important in the sense that it refers to the mission of the OPCW in preventing illicit use of chemicals as described and foreseen in the implementation of the CWC. This is yet another clear indication of the obligation that we need to fight against terrorism in all fora. 
I would like to thank the Technical Secretariat and congratulate the General Director once again for their invaluable contributions in organizing events to commemorate 10th anniversary of the entry into force of the Chemical Weapons Convention. I believe that such events do not only contributes to the objectives of the Convention but also improves the public awareness on Chemical Weapons Convention. 
Mr. Chairman, 
Last but not least, I would like to share with you a progress regarding the Turkish national implementation legislation of Chemical Weapons Convention and have the pleasure to inform you that said act came into force on 21 December 2006. On the other hand, implementation regulation of the said law is also being prepared by the relevant Turkish authorities. 
3 

Mr. Chairman, 
Having been involved in the work of the OPCW this year, I would like to extend my heartfelt gratitude to those who have invested their time and energy for creating a world, free of chemical weapons. In that respect, I wish to express my appreciation once again for the diligent work conducted by the Technical Secretariat under the able and wise supervision of the Director-General. 
Mr. Chairman, 
The Turkish Delegation looks forward to working with you and with the Secretariat constructively in the coming days and pledges its full support for the successful completion of the Conference. 
Thank you for your attention.

STATEMENT  
by H.E. Mr. Oleksandr Kupchyshyn 
 Ambassador, Permanent Representative  of Ukraine 
to the OPCW, Representative of Ukraine 
to the Twelfth Session of the Conference of States Parties to the Convention 
on the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons 
The Hague, 
6 November 2007 

Mr. Chairman, 
First of all I would like to join previous speakers in extending our warmest congratulations to you upon assumption of the Chairmanship of the Conference. We are convinced, that your skills will allow to steer successfully the work of the Twelfth Session of the Conference. In performing important duties you may completely rely on full support and co-operation of the delegation of Ukraine. 
I would also like to thank the former Chairman of the Conference, Ambassador Alfonso Dastis of Spain for his role and contribution to the success of the previous Eleventh Session of the Conference.  
On behalf of my Government I would like to assure you that Ukraine  is ready to provide full support to the work of the OPCW Policy-Making Organs and Technical Secretariat, proceeding from its faithful and strict compliance with the CWC provisions. 
The delegation of Ukraine associates itself with the Statement by the Ambassador of Portugal, delivered on behalf of the European Union. 
Mr. Chairman, 
Universality of the CWC is an important factor to enhance its credibility and ensure irreversible character of chemical disarmament in global dimension. Ukraine highly appreciates efforts undertaken in the framework of the Action Plan for universality, adopted in 2003, which calls for universal adherence to the Convention by 2007  the tenth year since its entry into force. Regrettably despite enormous and consistent efforts undertaken by the OPCW and regional organizations, numerous bilateral contacts of the State Parties with the States, which remain outside the Convention, this ambitious target has not been achieved so far. In this context I am nevertheless pleased to salute Barbados - the only state that joined the CWC in 2007. Ukraine expects that some other states engaged in internal procedures aimed at ensuring their membership in the OPCW, will follow this example. 
       Like many other State Parties Ukraine is particularly concerned by the fact that several countries in the Middle East display reluctance to join the CWC.  There is 
2 

no doubt that OPCW and its members should continue concerted efforts to pave the way for eventual adherence of all countries from the Middle East to the CWC. Ukraine maintains high level of bilateral relations with the countries from the Middle East, including non State Parties to the CWC, exercises balanced impartial approach to the parties involved in the main conflict in this region, and supports its peaceful resolution. 
From our perspective Ukraine could contribute to the efforts in the Middle East promoting the CWC universality. For this purpose Ukraine will be ready to host and carry out jointly with the OPCW an International conference with the participation of relevant countries, as well as other countries from the Middle East and Northern Africa. It is our expectation that such a conference might encourage the countries concerned to seriously reconsider their present position with regard to the CWC. 
Ukraine commends positive developments on the Korean peninsula which lead to the decrease of tension in this part of the world. We are convinced that trust and confidence shall prevail in relations between two Korean states and DPRK will ultimately join the CWC. 
Recent events in Myanmar have attracted attention of the UN, ASEAN, EU to the situation in this country, which by coincidence has not yet ratified the CWC. We think that major trading partners of Myanmar, who have excellent record and vast experience in the implementation of the CWC, may wish to play more significant role in promoting Myanmars ratification of the Convention. 
In general against the background of growing global challenges related to the climate change, population growth, spread of poverty and diseases, which are pressing on international agenda, position of some states to remain outside the regime, established by the CWC, seems unwise, outdated and selfish.  
We believe, however, that an active pace towards the universality of the Convention will be resumed in the next year.   
Mr. Chairman, 
Since chemical industry and science play a growing role in modern society, proper implementation of the Convention by its parties on national level is of critical importance for its viability. We are pleased to note that implementation of basic obligations pursuant to Article VII of the CWC is actively pursued in accordance with Sustaining follow-up to the Plan of Action regarding the implementation of Article VII obligations, adopted by the 11-th session of the Conference of States Parties (CSP). The number of State Parties with established National Authorities has reached now 173, but several other indicators concerning the national implementation legislation are still lagging behind. Upon its adoption the legislation should be constantly monitored by respective National Authority, which coordinates joint efforts of the military, police, security service, customs, boarder control, as well as of industrial, scientific and trade communities.  In this context we highly appreciate the assistance provided by donors to the countries, which have lack of resources and expertise in technical, legal or law enforcement 
3 

spheres. All these activities strengthen the confidence and trust, necessary to create basis for mutual cooperation within the CWC framework.   
Ukraine, therefore, stands ready to endorse further recommendations to the Conference in this field. 
From its part Ukraine has always displayed utmost responsibility in implementation of its obligations under the international treaties. The unconditional compliance with the CWC remains in the priority list of arms control, disarmament and non-proliferation policy of Ukraine.  
The proper compliance with obligations under the Convention is ensured by the National Program on CWC implementation for the ten-year period till 2008, which will be extended and amended next year. The Program co-ordinates activities of number of ministries and agencies involved in the process of CWC implementation. Ukraine has adopted appropriate legislation, which provides legal framework for the CWC implementation, including respective provisions in the countrys new Criminal Code. Ukraine strictly controls at the governmental level all export-import operations and transfers of scheduled chemicals.  
Mr. Chairman, 
Chemical disarmament will be in the focus of the OPCW in the years to come. Hopefully an increasing number of destruction facilities will start operating both in the Russian Federation and the USA.  Like many other delegations we attach particular importance to the timely destruction of chemical weapons stockpiles, accumulated by the possessor states. In this context we attach particular importance to the completion of destruction by Albania of its entire stockpiles of chemical weapons and extend our congratulations on this occasion to the Albanian delegation. 
One State Party and India are also making formidable progress in the destruction of their chemical weapons stockpiles. We expect that they will meet the established destruction time-frames. It is extremely important that all possessor states comply with their obligation to complete their CW destruction programs before 29 April 2012. 
Verification regime of the OPCW is a crucial element of  multilateral control over destruction of chemical weapons, as well as the tool to deter chemical proliferation. Ukraine, which has received two inspections of its chemical industry facilities in 2007, supports current OPCWs activities, aimed at maintenance of strict chemical non-proliferation regime. We, however, are in favour of more equitable and fair methodology in selection of the inspections for the OCPF (organic chemicals production facility), which should focus on the inspections of the facilities posing greater risks and diminish burden of inspection for the countries, which possess relatively small number of the OCPF on its territory. From our perspective it is obviously unfair that almost 40% of Ukraines OCPFs have been inspected, while average percentage of the inspected OCPF throughout 
4 

the world is approximately 10%. We also think that much might be done in order to improve planning inspections. This is important, especially for the countries with small or medium number of the OCPFs and  small secretariats of the National Authorities. In our case it is particularly uncomfortable when the dates of inspection coincide with annual session of the CSP or other meetings of the Policy Making Organs. Special attention should be given to the dates of the holidays, to the time gap between two subsequent inspections etc.       
Mr. Chairman, 
Ensuring the implementation of Article X of the CWC remains one of the most important tasks for the OPCW and its Members. We are pleased that two years since the conduct of the  Joint Assistance 2005 exercise ( Lviv, Ukraine, 9 -13.10. 2005), much is being done to draw the lessons and conclusions from this event, as exemplified by Director-Generals Note Follow-up to Joint Assistance 2005, issued earlier this year. We hope that this and subsequent follow-ups will be beneficial both for the Technical Secretariat and interested State Parties, especially, if the OPCW anticipates to continue the practice of conducting such major exercises. From Ukraines perspective State Parties may wish to start seriously thinking about such exercises after the completion of the Second Review Conference of the CWC in April 2008. 
This year Ukraine has hosted the OPCWs workshop on issues of cooperation between local emergency management authorities and international organisations, intended primarily for the practitioners from the Ministry of Emergencies. This workshop proved to be very fruitful and useful in the context of tasks and challenges, which should be addressed by national emergency services. 
National Authority of Ukraine has also resumed consultations with Technical Secretariat aimed at concluding bilateral agreement on assistance measures chosen by member states under Article X of the Convention. 
Mr. Chairman, 
Activities of the OPCW are based on an efficient budgetary system and we appreciate efforts of the Technical Secretariat to improve the effectiveness of cost management and measures to reduce some spending. Planned zero budget increase which is not expected to hamper effective functioning of the OPCW is a very important achievement of the Director-General and his team. We hope that the Conference will adopt the OPCW Program and the Budget for 2008 with due consideration of the needs and interests of both the OPCW as a whole and individual State Parties. 
Mr. Chairman, 
The twelfth Session of the CSP is conducted against the background of the 10-th anniversary since the CWC entry into force, while the set of international 
5 

events were organized to draw the attention of the governments, chemical industry, scientific community to the role of the CWC in disarmament, non-proliferation, assistance and protection, international cooperation in chemistry. From our perspective this campaign has reached its important goal and we are grateful to the contributors, which have made this possible. 
Mr. Chairman, 
At this Session of the Conference we are addressing issues that demand our close attention. The delegation of Ukraine is ready to co-operate fully with the delegations of other State Parties and the OPCW Secretariat to do its utmost to work for the implementation of the important task of the Organisation aimed at complete elimination of chemical weapons.  
Thank you for attention. 
STATEMENT BY 
ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF STATE 
FOR 
VERIFICATION, COMPLIANCE AND IMPLEMENTATION 
PAULA A. DESUTTER 
UNITED STATES DELEGATION 
TO THE 
12TH CONFERENCE OF STATES PARTIES 
OF THE 
ORGANIZATION FOR THE PROHIBITION OF CHEMICAL WEAPONS 
NOVEMBER 6, 2007 

STATUS OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE CONVENTION 
Mr. Chairman, Mr. Director-General, Distinguished Delegates: 
It is a great pleasure once again to join Ambassador Javits and the U.S. Delegation in underscoring U.S. verification, compliance and implementation interests in this notable body. I want to thank you, Mr. Chairman, and the other officers of the Conference, for another opportunity to do so, and for taking on the responsibility for guiding this distinguished body of delegates through the important work that is before the Conference of the States Parties this week.  
Three years ago, at the Ninth Conference of the States Parties, I had the honor to share with you the United States process and views on verification, compliance and compliance enforcement.  I explained the rigorous effort undertaken by the United States to formulate compliance judgments and urged States Parties to take seriously their role in this effort by understanding that each and every Party not only has the right, but the responsibility, to assess and draw its own conclusions about the compliance of its treaty partners.  We all must continue to be diligent in this area in order to ensure the success of this Organization and the common goal to exclude completely the possible use of chemical weapons.  The concerns I outlined then  including the collective responsibility to follow through on compliance concerns - have been reinforced by unfolding events over the past three years, particularly, the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty with Iran and North Korea. These events serve to demonstrate in concrete terms why all of us should care about compliance.  
Mr. Chairman, this Organization has many reasons to be proud.  This year alone is noteworthy as we celebrated the Tenth Anniversary of the Chemical Weapons Convention, took note of the historic achievement by Albania in becoming the first possessor State Party to eliminate its entire chemical weapons stockpile, watched the membership of the OPCW grow to 182 States Parties encompassing 98% of the global population, welcomed an increased number of States Parties moving ahead with the completion of their national implementation requirements under Article 
VII. Though more must be done, a collegial effort is underway to prepare for what we all anticipate will be a successful Review Conference in April 2008.  The OPCW has accomplished a great deal over the last decade and continues to set the standard for effective multilateralism through cooperation and steady progress.  We remain optimistic that such progress will continue under the leadership of the Director-General, with the hard work and effort of the Technical Secretariat and strong support and commitment by Member States.    
2 

Mr. Chairman, Ive come here today to congratulate this Organization, but also to urge that we do not become complacent in achievements.  Challenges lie ahead.            
Some of these challenges are already at our door step, such as the ongoing scientific developments in the area of chemical technology and the potential that such technology can be diverted to a chemical weapons program.  If this Organization is to continue to fulfill its promise into the future, it must keep in mind that the CWCs viability is contingent upon its effective verifiability.   Let me be clear. This does not, and should not be taken to mean that there is, or ever can be, certainty that a violation will always be detected.  However, effective verification should provide reasonable confidence that, under the circumstances, detection of noncompliance will occur in sufficient time for appropriate remedial responses to be undertaken, in order to reduce the threat presented by the violation, as well as to deny the violator the benefits of his wrongdoing.  The United States strongly believes that verification facilitates both deterrence and detection of noncompliance, and is an essential component of the Convention, and part of what we consider the compliance process, which includes compliance assessments and compliance enforcement.   
Mr. Chairman, it is vital that the Organization keep abreast of scientific and technological developments in the way chemicals are developed, produced and used, advances in monitoring technology, continued reorganization and diffusion of chemical industry operations and operational management.  We cannot afford to fall behind the advancement and evolution of the chemical industry if this treaty is to stand the test of time. We have to make sound recommendations that will ensure that verification keeps pace with changes in both the industry and the chemical weapons threat.       
In light of such developments, I urge member States to renew their awareness of their obligation to fully implement and comply with the provisions of Article I, often referred to as the General Purpose Criterion.  The fundamental objective of the Chemical Weapons Convention is to eliminate the threat posed by chemical weapons. The General Obligations for States Parties in Article I identify the core measures to attain this objective. These core measures include the commitment by States to never under any circumstances use, develop, produce, otherwise acquire, stockpile or retain chemical weapons.  These measures also include the obligation never to assist, encourage or induce, in any way, anyone to engage in any activity prohibited to a State Party under the Convention.  Let me also emphasize that States Parties must recognize that the chemical weapons threat goes beyond the 
3 

chemicals noted in the Schedules of Chemicals.  Additionally, the risk or the threat of use of toxic chemicals by non-state actors is also a reality, and should strengthen our resolve to fully implement our obligations in this area and work together to completely diminish any possibility of use by state or non-state actors.  Here I would only note the important linkage to U.N. Security Council Resolution 1540. 
Mr. Chairman, though the destruction of CW production facilities usually receives less attention than the destruction of CW stockpiles, it is an important aspect of the OPCWs work, since it focuses on eliminating the declared capacity of States Parties to produce additional chemical weapons.  While welcoming the near elimination of the worlds declared CW production capacity, it is also important for this body not to dismiss the possibility that some States Parties may have made preparations for possible future production of chemical agents, including retaining a CW production mobilization capability.  This could take the form of designating existing industrial facilities for potential CW production, or, in the most alarming situation, deliberatively establishing dual use facilities, under military or government control, that nominally are for purposes not prohibited by the Convention, but can be quickly converted to CW-related production if directed.  Any preparations for such activity would be a violation of the Convention; this Organization should be alert to such possibilities.  It is important in this context to recall the options available to States Parties under Article IX to pursue concerns.  One significant change the Organization can pursue to make Article IX consultations and visits more productive is to ensure that reports, particularly the Verification and Implementation Report, better known as the VIR, include information that is not proprietary.        
Mr. Chairman, Im under no illusion that the only challenges facing this Organization are the ones only beginning to emerge.  We all know there are a number of existing challenges facing this distinguished body, such as selection methodology and the inspection rate of other chemical production facilities, better known as OCPFs. As we continue to work toward an acceptable methodology for selecting such facilities for inspection, it is important to develop an approach that will give States Parties confidence that such sites are not being used for purposes prohibited by the Convention.  The proportion of OCPFs inspected is still very low and doesnt give much confidence of detecting, or even deterring possible violations. Im aware of some of the concerns by States Parties regarding frequency, and understand the issue of equitable distribution, but our objective should be to ensure that these sites do not pose a risk to the object and purpose of the Convention. The Director-General has worked hard and provided 
4 

member states a constructive interim approach, but I would encourage this body to accelerate its efforts to work out an acceptable resolution.     
Mr. Chairman, as you know one of the core obligations of the Convention is the complete destruction of chemical weapons stocks by Possessor States.  This has always been of great interest and concern for many in this Organization -- as it should be.  As Ambassador Javits noted in his opening statement, significant progress has been made on CW destruction, but there is more left to be done.  The United States will continue to do its part by completely destroying its CW stockpile in a manner that is safe and environmentally sound and will do so as soon as possible.  I urge the other Possessor States to completely destroy their chemical weapons in a manner that is safe, secure and in accordance with the CWC.  CW stocks should be destroyed in such a way that the chemical agents are converted in an essentially irreversible manner to a form unsuitable for production of CW, that renders munitions and other devices completely unusable, and finally, that ensure that this process is subject to full verification by the Technical Secretariat.  Anything less does not constitute destruction pursuant to the Convention. 
Mr. Chairman, I also would like to commend this Organization for its work in recognizing the need to strengthen its ability to respond rapidly and effectively to a request for an investigation of alleged use.  The development and maintenance of a strong capability to conduct thorough, expert investigations into allegations of CW use continues to be an important function and a vital verification tool, particularly in the area of bio-medical sampling and analysis.  This continues to be of great interest to me and my Government as we welcome the progress that has been made to date. I urge this organization to continue to support efforts that will ensure TS readiness in this area. 
Mr. Chairman, I want to encourage those States Parties that have not moved forward with their implementing legislation and establishment of National Authorities as required under Article VII to do so, and to keep their colleagues and the Technical Secretariat apprised of their progress.  There are approximately 20 States Parties with organic chemical manufacturing and trading activities that have not enacted comprehensive legislation, in accordance with their national implementation requirements.  The United States encourages these States Parties to quickly enact legislation, and we encourage the Technical Secretariat and all States Parties to urgently assist these member States in coming into compliance.  These provisions are required by all States Parties and compliance with these obligations strengthen global efforts to make it more difficult for state and non-state actors that seek to violate laws and the provisions set forth in the Convention.  There must be 
5 

continuity from the domestic level to the international level.  Not doing so risks weakening a key provision of this treaty and our fight against global terrorism. There must not be a break in the link.  There are also States Parties that have never made an initial declaration to the OPCW. Submission of declarations is a fundamental treaty requirement; States Parties that have not made initial declarations should work with the OPCW Technical Secretariat to move quickly to do so. 
Mr. Chairman, Mr. Director-General, Distinguished Delegates, as we move closer to the Second Review Conference, the Organization brings with it a long list of achievements, concrete progress, and a strong commitment to put the Organization and its objectives -- first laying aside any obstruction and pessimism that would hinder progress. This has been the kind of collaborative spirit, and mutual effort that has served this Organization well. Let us continue to remain vigilant --knowing that the Convention and its implementation contribute to enhancing international peace and security, and emphasizes that its full, universal and effective implementation and strict compliance will contribute further to that purpose by excluding completely, for the sake of all humankind, the possibility of the use of chemical weapons.  We have much to be pleased about, but a great deal more remains to be done.  The United States will continue to do its part, and stands ever willing to assist others in doing the same. 
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
