STATEMENT BY AMBASSADOR ROBERT P. MIKULAK 
UNITED STATES PERMANENT REPRESENTATIVE AT THE  
FIFTEENTH SESSION OF THE CONFERENCE OF THE STATES PARTIES  

Mr Chairman, Mr Director-General, distinguished delegates,  
I am pleased to be here among so many colleagues at the Fifteenth Session of the Conference of the States Parties.  I warmly welcome our new Chairman, Ambassador Julio Roberto Palomo Silva.  I have every confidence in his ability to guide us skilfully through our full agenda this week, and I pledge my own support and that of the entire United States delegation to making this a productive and successful session.  I also extend my deep appreciation to our outgoing Chairman, Ambassador Vaidotas Verba of Lithuania, and thank him for his dedication and exemplary service to this Organisation over the past year.   
Mr Chairman,  
This is the first Conference of the States Parties for our new Director-General Ambassador Ahmet Üzümcü.  His vision and guidance will be critical to the ongoing success of this 
Organisation, and we welcome his leadership. 
The many accomplishments that this Organisation has achieved within the bounds of fiscal 
responsibility are directly related to the hard work of the staff of the Technical Secretariat and 
I thank them as well. 
The first priority this week must be to bring the 2011 budget negotiation to a successful conclusion, drawing on our culture of cooperation and consensus building.  The United States delegation supports the proposal by the Director-General for a small increase in both OCPF inspections and in funding for international cooperation and assistance.  Some other delegations do not support this proposal. My delegation pledges its commitment to finding a balanced political solution that will strengthen both industry verification and international cooperation and assistance. Both elements are important for achieving the goals of the Chemical Weapons Convention.  We must give the Technical Secretariat the tools it needs to fulfil the object and purpose of the treaty so that never again will mankind face the evil of chemical weapons. 
CS-2010-6610(E) distributed 03/12/2010 *CS-2010-6610.E* 
Mr Chairman, 
Bringing the seven remaining non-Member States, particularly those that may possess chemical weapons, into the Convention, is essential to realise fully its objectives.  Experience has made clear that persuading them to join will not be easy.  All Member States, working together with the Director-General and the Technical Secretariat, should continue to signal that being a part of this Convention is part of being a full member in the community of nations. 
Joining the Convention is only the beginning of the story, however, and not the end.  The United States recognises that in many States Parties the work to fully implement Article VII obligations is far from finished. The Director-Generals annual report on Article VII implementation that is before us this week makes that clear.  In responding to the Director-Generals report, we as Member States must consider what more can be done to remedy the current situation.  The United States stands ready to provide Article VII support and technical assistance to any State Party requesting it.  It is also important to note that fulfilment of Article VII obligations also satisfies part of a Chemical Weapons Convention State Partys obligations under United Nations Security Council Resolution 1540 of 2004. The United States encourages all States Parties to take advantage of this mutually beneficial linkage.  When a State Party takes this important step, another gap is closed, and our collective security is enhanced. 
Mr Chairman,  
As 2011 ushers in the greatest transition the Organisation has yet faced, the Director-General and his senior management will need to re-align the Organisations activities, personnel, and budget while maintaining the support of the States Parties.  Indeed, the OPCW faces a critical period of transition that should be smooth, orderly, and transparent.  The United States looks forward to refinement by the States Parties of the tenure policy to provide the Director-General with necessary flexibility to retain or rehire the staff members he needs to run the Organisation most effectively.      
As possessor States continue working hard to complete the destruction of the remaining stockpiles, the OPCWs focus will naturally transition from disarmament to preventing acquisition of chemical weapons.  The provisions of Article VI are key tools for ensuring the non-proliferation of chemical weapons.  It will be essential for all States Parties to work cooperatively to achieve an effective balance among the different parts of the industrial verification regime, including that of the regime for other chemical production facilities. This regime was created by the negotiators of the Convention to capture a range of industrial facilities that were not Schedule 1, 2 or 3 facilities, but that still potentially posed some risk. Some of these facilities could be suitable for the illicit production of chemical weapons or even contain an embedded chemical weapons production mobilisation capability.  The regime is neither perfect nor complete, and it now falls to us to complete the task and develop a regime that is focused on those facilities that pose the greatest risk.  This should be a priority task for the Council in the coming year.   
The United States also believes that Articles IX, X, and XI are important for the future of the OPCW. The recently concluded ASSISTEX 3 exercise in Tunisia demonstrates the potential importance of Chemical Weapons Convention States Parties coming together to provide much needed international assistance in the event of a chemical attack by terrorists or another 
C-15/NAT.3 page 3 
State. Likewise, the OPCW also offers an excellent forum for discussing chemical safety and security issues.  The United States also fully supports the on-going work of the Open-Ended Working Group on Terrorism, and we congratulate Mr Mike Byers of Australia for his successful stewardship of the OEWG. 
Article XI also deserves increased attention.  The United States welcomes the just-concluded Article XI workshop, which considered ideas for more robust implementation of Article XI of the Convention. Participants offered a broad range of ideas to increase awareness and understanding of the goals of Article XI and how to promote linkages and information exchanges among States Parties and relevant subject matter experts.  Such forward-looking sessions are to be encouraged as we grapple with todays and tomorrows opportunities, as well as with threats and challenges to the Chemical Weapons Convention.   
Mr Chairman,  
I have spoken about a number of important items on our agenda.  I would now like to address a fundamental goal of this Organisation that is certainly on everyones mind this week:  the total destruction of chemical weapons.  For the United States, the safe and environmentally sound destruction of more than 27,000 metric tonnes of assorted chemical weapons is an enormous challenge.  It is one that the United States has made significant strides towards accomplishing, and I am proud to report on these achievements.    
The United States has met the 1%, 20%, and 45% treaty milestones. To date we have destroyed more than 81% of our Category 1 chemical weapons, which includes the destruction of over 82% of our chemical rockets, the destruction of 96.6% of our nerve agent, and the destruction of all of our binary chemical weapons.  The United States has also destroyed all of our former chemical weapons production facilities.  
I am pleased to announce that on 12 November 2010, the United States completed destruction of all chemical agent filled munitions at the Pine Bluff Chemical Agent Disposal Facility. This brings the number of stockpile chemical weapons destruction facilities that have completed operations to four. 
Currently, the United States has chemical weapons destruction facilities operating in Alabama, Oregon, and Utah at a cost of nearly USD 1 billion per annum with two additional sites under construction. To date, the United States has expended an estimated USD 22.1 billion for the destruction of chemical weapons in the United States. 
Over an extended period of time, the United States has confronted and successfully overcome a wide range of complex safety and environmental concerns raised by state and local authorities, as well as local citizens living near our chemical weapons storage and destruction facilities.  Technical issues that arose in the course of destruction operations have also been surmounted.  We have made, and will continue to make, every effort to ensure that our chemical weapons are destroyed consistent with the Convention:  safely, without harm to workers, people living near the facility, or the environment; verifiably, under the eyes of OPCW inspectors; and as rapidly as feasible. 
Mr Chairman,  
Let me assure you that the United States understands our obligations under the Convention, and we are fully committed to meeting the Conventions objectives, including verified destruction of 100% of our stockpile as rapidly and as safely as possible.  The Obama Administration is examining all viable options to accelerate our chemical weapons destruction activities further, consistent with the Convention and applicable United States safety, technical, and environmental requirements.  In 2006, the United States reported only 66% of its stockpile was expected to be destroyed by 2012, but we are now on pace to destroy 90% by that time.  We are continuing to seek ways to accelerate the programme further. 
We are also committed to proactive disclosure of our chemical weapons destruction programme, so that Member States can evaluate our efforts for themselves.  To that end, we have provided 90-day reports for the past four and one-half years that track our progress in three-month intervals.  We have also made informal destruction presentations at every informal meeting of the Executive Council on chemical weapons destruction to offer frank and honest information on our programme.  We have invited Executive Council representatives to make site visits to our facilitieswhich allow an opportunity for these representatives to observe first-hand the enormity and technical complexity of ongoing United States destruction, and construction efforts at the two chemical weapons destruction facilities. In fact, arrangements for an Executive Council visit to two United States facilities in March 2011 are well under way, with invitations already received by participants and observers.  We are optimistic that this will be another productive visit. 
Tomorrow, (30 November) at 2:00 pm, the United States delegation will provide an informal presentation on the status of United States chemical weapons destruction efforts, which will be delivered by Mr Andrew Weber, Assistant to the Secretary of Defense for Nuclear and Chemical and Biological Defense Programs.  We offered a similar presentation last year, which garnered considerable interest and attention.  This year Mr Weber has returned to demonstrate our continuing commitment to transparency and 100% destruction. 
The United States will continue to provide the transparency measures necessary to ensure that the Member States of this Organisation have confidence in our chemical weapons destruction efforts.   
Mr Chairman, 
As the States Parties consider the issue of managing the 2012 extended destruction deadline, the United States wants to reassure States Parties that we agree that rewriting or reinterpreting of the Convention is not an acceptable means for resolving this issue.  In fact, we believe that this point should be reflected in the Conference report.   
The United States is interested in hearing other delegations proposals for a political solution within the legal framework of the Convention. In this regard, we note the interesting approach put forward by the Brazilian delegation.  We are actively considering what the United States can do to increase the confidence of the other States Parties that we will complete the safe destruction of our chemical weapons stockpile in a timely manner.   
C-15/NAT.3 page 5 
Mr Chairman, 
Although there is considerable attention to what must still be done, we should not lose sight of the enormous accomplishments already achieved towards the aim of complete destruction of chemical weapons.  It is important that we acknowledge and appreciate the efforts made by possessor States Parties and encourage continued efforts in a constructive and cooperative atmosphere.  This year marked the commencement of chemical weapons destruction in Libya as well as the beginning of the destruction of abandoned chemical weapons in China by Japan. We understand that the Technical Secretariat and the Republic of Iraq have made significant strides toward developing a strategy for the destruction of chemical weapons remnants in Iraq.  The largest single possessor of chemical weapons, the Russian Federation, has destroyed almost half of its chemical weapons stockpile.  And as I mentioned earlier, the United States has destroyed more than 81% of its chemical weapons.  These accomplishments, coupled with the previous achievements of complete destruction by A State Party, India, and Albania, represent massive efforts that should not be overshadowed by emphasis on what remains to be done.  These efforts demonstrate that this Convention is working and fulfilling its purpose.  This Organisation is succeeding, and without a doubt, it will continue to do so until the core objective of the Convention is met:  a world free of chemical weapons.    
Finally, we must all begin to consider together what kind of OPCW we want in the future. The budget for 2012 will need to begin to reflect that vision.  We need to consider the challenges that are already looming, such as the need to adapt OPCW activities to advances in science and technology and to changes in the chemical industry.  We need to discuss and reach agreement on a programme of activities that provides real value for States Parties.  The United States commends the Director-General for seeking the advice of an outside panel of experts and looks forward to reviewing and discussing their recommendations. 
Lastly, Mr Chairman,  
One delegation recently alleged that the United States was not in compliance with the Chemical Weapons Convention in the manner in which it recovered and destroyed pre-1991-era chemical weapons in Iraq.  Our immediate destruction of these weapons did not violate the treaty and indeed was necessary to support the object and purpose of the treaty.  It was also necessary to protect our forces, the local populace, the environment and the stability of Iraq. Our actions were fully consistent with our Article I obligations to never under any circumstances develop, produce, otherwise acquire, stockpile or retain chemical weapons. The United States rejects as totally unfounded any allegation that it violated the Chemical Weapons Convention in these unusual and unforeseen circumstances. 
I request that this statement be circulated as an official document to the Conference.  Thank you, Mr Chairman.

OPCW 	Conference of the States Parties 
Fifteenth Session C-15/NAT.4 29 November  3 December 2010 29 November 2010  Original: ENGLISH 
SOUTH AFRICA 

STATEMENT ON BEHALF OF THE AFRICAN GROUP OF STATES PARTIES  
TO THE CHEMICAL WEAPONS CONVENTION AT THE  
FIFTEENTH SESSION OF THE CONFERENCE OF THE STATES PARTIES  

Mr Chairperson, 
1. 	
On behalf of the African Group, I would like to congratulate you on your election as Chairperson of the Fifteenth Session of the Conference of the States Parties.  We are confident that you will steer our work to a successful conclusion and we assure you of our full cooperation and support for your efforts. 

2. 	
I am also pleased to convey the African Groups appreciation to the outgoing Chairperson, Ambassador Vaidotas Verba of Lithuania, for his commitment and hard work as Chairperson of the Fourteenth Session of the Conference of the States Parties.  

3. 	
The African Group associates itself with the statement made by Cuba on behalf of the Chairperson of the Non-Aligned Movement and China.  

4. 	
We also wish to extend a word of welcome to Ambassador Üzümcü who is attending his first Conference of the States Parties as Director-General and the Group thanks him for his opening statement on the activities of the Organisation.  

Mr Chairperson, 

5. 	
The African States Parties reiterate their firm conviction that the destruction of all chemical weapons is one of the primary objectives of this Organisation.  We have therefore taken note of the destruction efforts undertaken by the possessor States Parties during the past year and we commend them for their efforts and the progress they are making.  

6. 	
While the African Group is pleased to acknowledge the progress being made in destroying these weapons, we again have to register our concern at the large quantity of chemical weapons stockpiles that still has to be destroyed with 16 months remaining before the final extended destruction deadline.  We once again reiterate our call to the major possessor States Parties to ensure that they complete their destruction programmes within the deadline provided for in the Convention, and in accordance with the decisions of the Eleventh Session of the Conference of the States Parties. 


CS-2010-6613(E) distributed 03/12/2010 	*CS-2010-6613.E* 
7. 	
A significant development has taken place during the past year in that the Russian Federation has now also joined the United States in indicating that it does not expect to meet its destruction obligations.  The African States Parties are concerned about this development and we urge the United States and the Russian Federation to make all possible efforts to complete their destruction activities within the agreed extended deadline. 

8. 	
While the African Group continues to hope that all of the possessor States Parties will comply with the final extended destruction deadline, we do not currently have any grounds to believe that the difficulties that we are being forced to confront are symptoms of any bad faith or any attempt to circumvent the basic objective of the Convention (namely the elimination of all chemical weapons).  As the Conference of the States Parties responsible for overseeing the implementation of, and adherence to, the Chemical Weapons Convention, we should nevertheless prepare ourselves by laying down the ground rules for dealing with the eventuality that the final extended destruction deadline of the Convention may not be met.  

9. 	
In view of this, the Group believes that this Conference should, as it did during its Fourteenth Session, clearly address this matter in its report.  For this purpose, sufficient agreed Executive Council report language exists on which the Conference can draw to formulate its views on the following:  


. The importance of maintaining the integrity of the Convention; 
. Preventing any action that would undermine the Convention; 
. Compliance with the extended destruction deadline; 
. The commitment of the major possessor States Parties to complete their 

destruction activities; and . Countering efforts that could lead to rewriting or reinterpreting the Conventions provisions. 
10. 	
The Group trusts that other States Parties would once again join our efforts to include wording in the report of the Conference so as to ensure that we protect the integrity of the Convention. 

11. 	
The African Group supports the request by Libya to modify the dates of its intermediate destruction deadlines as approved by the Conference of the States Parties at its Fourteenth Session. We believe this request can best be handled by the Conference by amending its decision on this matter, C-14/DEC.3.  We look forward to the adoption of the draft decision which the Sixty-Second Session of the Executive Council has recommended to the Conference for its consideration.  

Mr Chairperson, 

12. 	
African States Parties continue to make good progress in the implementation of their national obligations under the Convention, in particular efforts to implement their national implementation measures. We remain committed to meeting all our obligations in full.  Adequate and timely assistance to requesting States Parties remains important, however, in order to fulfil this objective.  We look forward to the continued provision of such assistance. 


C-15/NAT.4 page 3 
Mr Chairperson, 
13. 	
The Second Review Conference urged the Executive Council to reach early agreement on the full implementation of Article XI as well as calling for adequate funding to be made available for capacity building and transfer of skills programmes.  

14. 	
The full implementation of Article XI is of particular importance in order to ensure the Convention remains relevant for the majority of States Parties that possess neither chemical weapons nor any substantial chemical industry.  By assisting these States Parties in the development of their chemical capacity and industry we in turn greatly enhance their ability to contribute to the maintenance of international and regional peace and security. 

15. 	
The African Group is pleased to note the workshop on the implementation of Article XI which took place from 24 to 25 November 2010, in The Hague.  We look forward to the outcome of this workshop making a substantive contribution to efforts to develop concrete measures to ensure the promotion of international cooperation in the field of chemical activities through the exchange of scientific and technical information, chemicals, and equipment. 

Mr Chairperson, 

16. 	
The African Group of States Parties notes with appreciation the extension of the Programme for Africa by the Director-General for another three years. We look forward to continued cooperation with the Technical Secretariat to strengthen the Programme by developing new actions and projects that would contribute directly to capacity building and the transfer of skills to African States Parties as well as assisting them with the implementation of the Convention. 

17. 	
We further note with appreciation the voluntary contributions made by some donor States Parties through the Programme for Africa as well as the contributions, including in-kind contributions, which African States Parties continue to make in the implementation of the Programme. 

Mr Chairperson, 

18. 	
African States Parties attach great value to the implementation of Article X, which provides for assistance and protection to States Parties against chemical weapons.  It is important in this regard to ensure practical capacity building as well as the transfer of material and equipment to deal with chemical incidents on a regional and subregional basis. The movement of chemicals across borders in Africa also calls for a responsive Organisation that is able to address a wide range of chemical incidents. 

19. 	
It is important that training and assistance programmes of the OPCW continue to focus on establishing or strengthening States Parties capacity to respond to a chemical attack or incident.  The Organisation also needs to ensure that it can adequately respond to requests from African States Parties. 

20. 	
African States Parties note with satisfaction the successful conclusion of the exercise on the delivery of assistanceASSISTEX 3which took place from 11 to 


15 October 2010 in Tunis, Tunisia.  We extend our appreciation to the host country Tunisia for undertaking this important task and commend the Tunisian authorities for the professional manner in which the exercise was hosted.  The Group further extends its appreciation to all participating States Parties as well as the Technical Secretariat and other organisations that contributed to the successful conclusion of ASSISTEX 3.  
Mr Chairperson, 
21. 	
The threat of global terrorism which confronts us gives added urgency to the work of our Organisation. The African States Parties believe that the contribution to global anti-terrorism efforts in the context of the Convention can be best achieved by the full, effective, and non-discriminatory implementation of all provisions of the Convention. The OPCW has a particular role to play among international organisations in preventing access to chemical weapons by non-State actors and by providing assistance in the event of a chemical attack.  In this framework, the implementation of Article X is of particular importance.   

22. 	
The Group also wish to highlight the significance of international cooperation in the context of the Convention, in preventing terrorists from acquiring and/or using chemical weapons and welcome all positive collaboration and cooperation between the OPCW, States Parties, and regional centres for counter-terrorism, such as the African Centre for the Study and Research on Terrorism in Algiers. 

23. 	
The African Group is of the view that the work of the Open-Ended Working Group on Terrorism should be seen in this perspective and should avoid a selective approach by only addressing some of the articles of the Convention and not others.  We need to be mindful that the obligation to implement the Convention has its origin in the Convention itself and not in any extraneous resolution or law.  We recall that the Second Review Conference set clear parameters for the OPCWs role in global anti-terrorism efforts by reaffirming the independent and autonomous nature of the OPCW as a disarmament and peaceful use organisation.  

Mr Chairperson, 

24. 	
The African Group looks forward to the successful conclusion of the consultations on the 2011 draft programme and Budget for the Organisation during the course of the Conference. We are pleased to note that additional, even if only limited, funding has been proposed for the cooperation and assistance activities of the Organisation and African States Parties would be able to join a consensus that preserves this allocation in the Budget. On the issue of the number of annual inspections of other chemical production facilities (OCPFs), the Group is of the view that this matter cannot be effectively addressed in the context of the annual budget consultations. The contentious discussions and debates that accompany this issue during every years budget consultations have clearly shown that the number of OCPF inspections is not a financial but a technical issue. As such, any solution that might be found during this years budget consultations will only be temporary in nature.  


C-15/NAT.4 page 5 
Mr Chairperson, 
25. 	
On the issue of the composition of the staff of the Organisation, we continue to urge the Technical Secretariat to ensure, through its recruitment processes, equitable geographical and gender representation in the professional ranks of the Organisation, particularly in senior and management positions.  In this regard, the African States Parties look forward to the adoption by the Conference of the draft decision on the composition of the Technical Secretariat.  The annual reports which will be provided on this basis to States Parties on the representation of State Party nationals in professional level positions in the Technical Secretariat will be most helpful in order to focus the Technical Secretariats recruitment efforts to address under representation. 

Mr Chairperson, 

26. 	
The African States Parties have noted with interest the initiative of the Director-General to set up a panel of eminent experts in the field of disarmament and non-proliferation to formulate recommendations on the future priorities of the Organisation once destruction efforts wind down.  The African Group looks forward to receiving more information on this initiative, including efforts to ensure that the full range of States Parties interests is represented on the panel.  We are also hopeful that the outcome of the panels work will positively contribute to the discussions among the States Parties on the future priorities of the Organisation. 

27. 	
We would like to request that this statement be circulated as an official document of the Fifteenth Session of the Conference of the States Parties. 


Thank you.

OPCW 	Conference of the States Parties 
Fifteenth Session C-15/NAT.6 29 November  3 December 2010 30 November 2010 ENGLISH only 
THAILAND 
STATEMENT BY H.E. MR VIRACHAI PLASAI, PERMANENT REPRESENTATIVE 
OF THE KINGDOM OF THAILAND TO THE ORGANISATION FOR THE 
PROHIBITION OF CHEMICAL WEAPONS AT THE 
FIFTEENTH SESSION OF THE CONFERENCE OF THE STATES PARTIES 

Mr Chairperson, 
Mr Director-General, 
Excellencies, 
Distinguished delegates, 
Ladies and gentlemen, 

1. 	
First of all, let me join other delegations in congratulating you, Ambassador Julio Roberto Palomo Silva, as the Chairperson of this years session of the Conference of the States Parties.  I am confident that under your able leadership, this session will proceed smoothly and lead to successful outcomes.  Allow me also to extend to the outgoing Chairperson, His Excellency Ambassador Vaidotas Verba, my delegations appreciation for his wise leadership and the good works achieved during the Fourteenth Session of the Conference of the States Parties.  

2. 	
I also wish to welcome His Excellency Ambassador Ahmet Üzümcü, Director-General of the OPCW, for the first time at the Conference of the States Parties and congratulate him for his opening statement which is very comprehensive and encompasses all the important aspects of the Chemical Weapons Convention.  My delegation would like to reaffirm our full support for his mission as Director-General of the OPCW.  We are confident that through his tireless efforts to carry forward the work of the OPCW, full and effective implementation of the Chemical Weapons Convention will be ensured. 

Mr Chairperson, 

3. 	
The continued existence of weapons of mass destruction poses a grave threat to humanity and international peace and security.  The Kingdom of Thailand reiterates its unequivocal position on complete disarmament of all types of weapons of mass destruction. We are firmly committed to the goals of the Chemical Weapons Convention and have rendered our full support to the work of the OPCW and the effective and non-discriminatory implementation of the Convention.  


CS-2010-6615(E) distributed 03/12/2010 	*CS-2010-6615.E* 
4. 	
The Kingdom of Thailand on its part has adopted various necessary measures to fully implement its obligations under the Chemical Weapons Convention in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Convention.  Our National Authority has also been fully cooperating with the OPCW with regard to our annual declaration of past and anticipated activities as well as inspections of schedule chemical production facilities sites and other chemical production facilities sites.     

5. 	
To further enhance our cooperation with the OPCW, I am pleased to confirm that the Royal Thai Government will co-organise, together with the Technical Secretariat, the next OPCW challenge inspection field exercise in Thailand between 31 October and 4 November 2011.  This will be the first such exercise to take place in Asia. 

6. 	
The exercise will be held in an industrial operating plant site which was selected by the Thai authorities to meet the Technical Secretariats testing requirements.  We are confident that facilities at the chosen site will provide a constructive environment for a fruitful exercise.  The Thai National Authority has already hosted two preparatory meetings with the Technical Secretariats planning team in June and September this year. During those meetings, two visits to the exercise plant site were conducted; an outline scenario was developed; a first coaching session was conducted on the Convention provisions on challenge inspection and was attended by a number of representatives of various Thai agencies that will be involved in the exercise.  Further preparatory meetings will be held in 2011; the Thai Authorities and the Technical Secretariats planning team will continue to work closely together in the coming months, including, among others, on the conclusion of a formal agreement which will govern the conduct of the exercise. 

Mr Chairperson, 

7. 	
The Kingdom of Thailand supports the universality of the Convention, which is reputed to be a highly credible and effective disarmament instrument aimed at the total elimination of an entire category of weapons of mass destruction.  The verification system provided for under the Convention is considered the most comprehensive to have been formulated for a multilateral agreement in the field of disarmament.  We therefore urge the remaining States outside the Convention to ratify or accede to it without further delay. Only with universal adherence to and implementation of the Convention will we be able to effectively rid the world of the potential harms of chemical weapons.   

8. 	
The Kingdom of Thailand welcomes the dedication and commitment demonstrated by possessor States Parties to the achievement of the total destruction of their chemical weapons stockpiles. We also welcome the progress made so far.  With more than approximately 37% of declared chemical weapons to be destroyed by the extended deadline of April 2012, we reiterate the importance of the completion of the destruction of chemical weapons within the agreed timeframe.  Failure to do so would affect the credibility, integrity, and effectiveness of the Convention.  We therefore urge the remaining possessor States Parties to fulfil their obligations in a timely manner.    


C-15/NAT.6 page 3 
Mr Chairperson, 
9. 	
International cooperation is another vital component of the Convention.  The Kingdom of Thailand commends the OPCWs continued hard work in organising capacity-building activities under its international cooperation programmes to promote peaceful application of chemicals and legitimate activities of the chemical industry. These activities are of great importance for many countries, especially those with a developing economy.  International cooperation in the field of chemical activities including the exchange of chemicals, equipment, and scientific and technical information should also be promoted in accordance with Article XI on economic and technological developments. 

10. 	
In this regard, the Kingdom of Thailand reiterates its complete support for the ongoing informal consultations on the full implementation of Article XI.  With the expertise of the Technical Secretariat, my delegation believes that exchange of views and experience among States Parties and relevant stakeholders can be instrumental in the development of concrete and appropriate measures towards this end, as reflected by the fruitful discussion we had during the recent workshop on the implementation of Article XI held last week, in The Hague.  We look forward to cooperating closely with other States Parties and the OPCW to ensure the full, effective, and non-discriminatory implementation of Article XI.  

11. 	
To further enhance the object and purpose and the effective implementation of the Convention, cooperation should also be explored in the area of data sharing among National Authorities on imports and exports of scheduled chemicals.  Networking among National Authorities should be encouraged to enable them to more effectively monitor and control scheduled chemicals.  More importantly, through cooperation among National Authorities, we should aim at eliminating any possibility of discrepancy between quantities of scheduled chemicals declared by importing and exporting States Parties. 

12. 	
In light of the expansion of chemical industries worldwide, the issues of chemical safety and security are also of high importance.  Cooperation should be enhanced among chemical industries in States Parties in promoting safe and secure operation of chemical production, transportation and storage facilities.  Also of great value would be capacity building and training programmes for States Parties in the prevention of chemical accidents as well as the management of chemical disasters and response to emergencies.  We would also like to reiterate our support to the recommendations of the Asian Group to the Twelfth Annual Meeting of National Authorities, held in The Hague from 26 to 28 November 2010.  We believe that implementation of these recommendations will help enhance the full and effective implementation of the Convention. 

Mr Chairperson, 

13. 	
While the threat of use of chemical weapons is receding, concerns have shifted to the possibility of non-State actors gaining access to or making chemical weapons.  The OPCW has an important role to play in the international anti-terrorism efforts.  

14. 	
Universal adherence to and full implementation of the Convention reduces the risks of chemical weapons falling into the wrong hands, thereby contributing to the implementation of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1540 and the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy.  The Kingdom of Thailand commends the OPCW for the continued cooperation it rendered to the 1540 Committee and other relevant United Nations bodies, including the Counter-Terrorism Committee and the Counter-Terrorism Executive Directorate. Although the OPCW is not an anti-terrorism organisation, its work rightly complements international efforts to prevent terrorist attacks involving chemicals and raise the preparedness of States Parties to respond to such threat. 

Mr Chairperson, 

15. 	
The Convention is rightly seen by many as an exemplary achievement of the multilateral efforts on disarmament. With our continued determination and commitment, it can also become a true success story of the international community. I wish to assure you, Mr Chairperson, of Thailands commitment to working closely and constructively with other States Parties and the OPCW towards the success of this Conference and the attainment of the goals of the Convention. 

16. 	
In conclusion, Mr Chairperson, I wish to stress that the Kingdom of Thailand fully supports the positions expressed in the statement of the NAM CWC States Parties and China, which has been delivered by H.E. Ambassador Zelmys Dominguez Cortina of the Republic of Cuba. I also wish to request that this statement be circulated as an official document of the Fifteenth Session of the Conference of the States Parties. 


I thank you.

Fifteenth Session C-15/NAT.8 29 November  3 December 2010 29 November 2010 ENGLISH only 
REPUBLIC OF CUBA 
STATEMENT BY H.E AMBASSADOR ZELMYS DOMINGUEZ CORTINA  
ON BEHALF OF THE MEMBER STATES 
OF THE NON-ALIGNED MOVEMENT THAT ARE STATES PARTIES TO THE 
CHEMICAL WEAPONS CONVENTION AND CHINA  
AT THE FIFTEENTH SESSION OF THE CONFERENCE OF THE STATES PARTIES 

Mr Chairperson, 
1. 	
On behalf of the Members States of the Non-Aligned Movement that are States Parties to the Chemical Weapons Convention, and China (the NAM CWC States Parties and China) I would like to welcome you, Ambassador of Guatemala, Julio Roberto Palomo Silva, a representative of a Member State of the NAM, as Chairman of this Conference of the States Parties to the Chemical Weapons Convention.  We are confident that your knowledge, skills, and experience will enable you to steer our work to a successful conclusion and I assure you of the full support of the NAM CWC States Parties and China. 

2. 	
I also take this opportunity to thank the outgoing Chairperson, Ambassador Vaidotas Verba, Ambassador of Lithuania, for his dedicated work as Chair of the Fourteenth Session of the Conference of the States Parties.  I also wish to congratulate the newly elected Bureau members of this Fifteenth Session of the Conference.  

3. 	
We would like to welcome Ambassador Ahmet Üzümcü for the first time at the Conference of the States Parties and reaffirm to him our fullest support in the fulfilment of his new task as Director-General.  We would also like to thank him for the presentation of his opening statement.  

4. 	
The NAM CWC States Parties and China, committed to the full and non-discriminatory implementation of the Convention, wish to outline their position on important issues under consideration at this session of the Conference of the States Parties. The NAM CWC States Parties and China welcome the important role played by NAM Member States in their role as facilitators, including Algeria (Ambassador Nassima Baghli as facilitator of captive use of Schedule 1 chemicals), China (Mr Chen Kai as facilitator on Article XI), Chile (alternate representative Mr Rodrigo Waghorn as co-facilitator for the draft 2011 Programme and Budget), Iran (Ambassador Kazem Gharib Abadi as Vice-Chairman on administrative and financial issues), Lebanon (Mr Rami Adwan as facilitator on Article VII), Malaysia (Ambassador Dr Fauziah Mohammad Taib as co-facilitator on site-selection 


CS-2010-6619(E) distributed 03/12/2010 	*CS-2010-6619.E* 
methodology), Pakistan (Ambassador Aizaz Ahmad Chaudhry as facilitator on composition of the Secretariat) and South Africa (Ambassador Peter Goosen as Vice-Chairman on the industry cluster issues and Marthinus Van Schalkwyk as facilitator of enhancement of OCPF declarations).  
Mr Chairperson, 
5. 	
The existence of weapons of mass destruction continues to pose a threat to international peace and security. Consequently, the NAM CWC States Parties and China reiterate their long-standing principled position regarding the achievement of general and complete disarmament, under strict and effective international control, including the prohibition and elimination of all weapons of mass destruction in line with the first preambular paragraph of the Convention. 

6. 	
We stress that the total destruction of chemical weapons is one of the fundamental pillars of the Convention.  In this regard, completion of destruction of all chemical weapons, including abandoned chemical weapons, within the final extended deadline of 29 April 2012, as set forth in the Convention, constitutes an integral part of the obligations by the chemical weapons possessor States and by abandoning States Parties. 

7. 	
Since more than 37% of chemical weapons stockpiles are yet to be destroyed and the destruction of a significant number of abandoned chemical weapons is yet to start, the NAM CWC States Parties and China reiterate their serious concern about the pace of destruction of chemical weapons, as well as the destruction of abandoned chemical weapons, in light of the fast-approaching final extended deadline of 29 April 2012. We therefore reaffirm that verification of the destruction of the remaining chemical weapons stockpiles shall continue to be the top priority of the Technical Secretariat.  

8. 	
In this regard, the NAM CWC States Parties and China continue to be actively involved in the ongoing informal consultations conducted by the Council Chairperson on how and when to initiate discussions by the Council on issues related to meeting the final extended deadline for the destruction of chemical weapons and we look forward to making tangible progress during these deliberations in line with this mandate. We consider it important to emphasise that the outcome of these consultations will uphold and not undermine the integrity and credibility of the Convention. 

9. 	
A further source of grave concern is that, according to the available reports, the United States of America and the Russian Federation may not be in a position to meet the final extended deadline for the destruction of their chemical weapons stockpiles, which endangers the credibility and the integrity of the Chemical Weapons Convention. We, therefore, urge all possessor States Parties to take every necessary measure to ensure compliance with the final extended deadline for the destruction of all their chemical weapons stockpiles. 

10. 	
We are of the firm belief that this Conference, in line with the decision taken at its Eleventh Session, and as underlined by the Second Review Conference, shall once again emphasise the obligations of possessor States Parties to complete the 


C-15/NAT.8 page 3 
destruction of their chemical weapons stockpiles within the final extended deadline of 29 April 2012. 
11. 	
The NAM CWC States Parties and China reaffirm the significance of the information that the Director-General submits to each regular session of the Executive Council, in consultation with the relevant possessor States Parties, on the progress achieved through the measures that have been undertaken to accelerate the destruction of the remaining stockpiles.  This will allow States Parties to better monitor and assess the situation in order to make appropriate suggestions in this regard. 

12. 	
While welcoming the initial steps towards starting operations to destroy chemical weapons abandoned by Japan in China, the NAM CWC States Parties and China note with concern that a large quantity of abandoned chemical weapons remains to be destroyed, and call upon the relevant abandoning State Party to make the fullest possible effort to complete destruction by the final extended deadline of 29 April 2012. 

Mr Chairperson, 

13. 	
The NAM CWC States Parties and China firmly believe that the effective contribution of the Convention to international and regional peace and security can be enhanced by full universality of the Convention. 

14. 	
We commend the Technical Secretariat and the States Parties for their efforts to promote the universality of the Convention, which is fundamental to the realisation of its object and purpose. We urge all States that have still not joined the Convention to do so without further delay, particularly those whose non-adherence to the Convention has given rise to serious concern. In this regard, we request the Technical Secretariat and States Parties in a position to do so, to redouble their efforts with a view to achieving full universality at the earliest possible date. 

Mr Chairperson, 

15. 	
The NAM CWC States Parties and China recall the importance of the provisions of Article XI of the Convention, underlined by the Second Review Conference, and emphasise that the full, effective, and non-discriminatory implementation of this article is essential for the realisation of the object and purpose of the Convention. States Parties are obliged to implement the Convention in a manner that avoids hampering the economic or technological development of States Parties, as well as international cooperation in the field of chemical activities for purposes not prohibited under the Convention. 

16. 	
We strongly believe that it is imperative to ensure the removal of and to avoid the imposition of any restrictions that are contrary to the letter and spirit of the Convention. In this context, we call upon the developed countries to fulfil their commitment to transfer technology, material, and equipment for peaceful purposes in the chemical field and to remove any discriminatory restrictions which affect the Conventions long-term viability and have an adverse impact on the trust existing among States Parties.  We emphasise that the objectives of the Convention can be best 

achieved through multilaterally negotiated, universal, comprehensive, and non-discriminatory agreements by all States Parties. 

17. 	
Guided by the experience gained by the Organisation in the implementation of other provisions of the Convention through action plans, the NAM CWC States Parties and China reaffirm their full support for the ongoing informal consultations on the full implementation of Article XI.  We look forward to the outcome of the recent workshop on Article XI contributing to more substantive deliberations in order to expeditiously identify and develop concrete measures within an agreed framework to ensure the full, effective, and non-discriminatory implementation of Article XI.  

Mr Chairperson, 

18. 	
The NAM CWC States Parties and China reaffirm that the implementation of Article X of the Convention on assistance and protection against chemical weapons makes a significant contribution to countering the threats of the use of chemical weapons. We stress the importance of achieving and maintaining a high level of readiness of the OPCW to provide timely, adequate, and effective assistance and protection to its States Parties in situations of use or threat of use of chemical weapons against them.  In this regard we would like to commend the host country Tunisia, the Technical Secretariat, and the States Parties involved in the successful conduct of the exercise on the delivery of assistance, ASSISTEX 3 in Tunis this October. 

19. 	
NAM CWC States Parties and China welcome the Executive Councils decision to commemorate annually the victims of the chemical weapons attacks in Sardasht in the Islamic Republic of Iran and Halabja in the Republic of Iraq.  While paying due respect to all chemical weapons victims and their families, the NAM CWC States Parties and China reiterate their firm conviction that international support for providing special care and assistance to all victims suffering the effects of exposure to chemical weapons is an urgent humanitarian need and that the States Parties to the Convention, as well as the OPCW, should pay urgent attention to meeting such needs. In this regard, we look forward to an early start of discussions on the proposal for the establishment of an international support network for the victims of chemical weapons. 

20. 	
The NAM CWC States Parties and China acknowledge the contribution of the OPCW to global anti-terrorism efforts through full, effective, and non-discriminatory implementation of the Convention, although the OPCW is not an anti-terrorism Organisation. The NAM CWC States Parties and China have taken note of the work that has taken place under the Open-Ended Working Group on Terrorism related to universality, Article X, and Article VII, and urge the facilitator of the Working Group to also address other articles such as IV and V.  The work of the Open-Ended Working Group on Terrorism should be seen in this perspective and should avoid a selective approach only to some articles.  We need to be mindful that the obligation to implement the Convention has its origin in the Convention itself and not in any extraneous resolution or law. We recall that the Second Review Conference set clear parameters for OPCWs role in global anti-terrorism efforts by reaffirming the independent and autonomous nature of the OPCW.  The NAM CWC States Parties 


C-15/NAT.8 page 5 
and China highlight the significance of international cooperation in the context of the Convention, in preventing terrorists from acquiring and/or using chemical weapons.  
Mr Chairperson, 
21. 	
The verification regime of the OPCW is an important element in the implementation of the relevant provisions of the Convention.  The NAM CWC States Parties and China are committed to participating in the ongoing consultations regarding the unresolved issues related to industry verification. 

22. 	
We stress the relevant paragraphs of the report of the Second Review Conference (RC-2/4) with regard to declaration and inspection of OCPF sites.  The NAM CWC States Parties and China reiterate the desirability of directing inspections towards facilities of greater relevance to the object and purpose of the Convention, and that any proposals to be considered regarding this subject shall exclude the possibility of additional declaration obligations and shall correspond strictly with Part IX of the Verification Annex of the Convention, which is based on the concept of hierarchy of risk. 

23. 	
Furthermore, as it was reiterated in the report of the Second Review Conference (paragraph 9.66), any changes in the frequency of OCPF inspections, if required, shall take into account any refinements to the OCPF inspection regime or improvements in site-selection methodology, and should be based on a thorough discussion and a decision of the policy-making organs.  The NAM CWC States Parties and China recall decisions C-13/DEC.5 and C-14/DEC.8, and stress that the number of Article VI inspections should be determined within the relevant Industry Cluster consultations and be agreed by the States Parties as a matter of policy, taking into account budgetary and other relevant considerations. 

24. 	
We recall that the modified methodology for the selection of other chemical production facilities for inspection, currently being implemented by the Technical Secretariat, is considered by the NAM CWC States Parties and China as an interim measure.  The site-selection methodology should be in accordance with the provisions of the Convention, and needs to be thoroughly discussed and adopted by consensus. In this regard, we would like to welcome the continuation of the facilitation to resolve this important issue and wish to assure the co-facilitators of our full support for their efforts.  

25. 	
In the context of the implementation of Article VII, we encourage all States Parties and the Technical Secretariat to continue to provide meaningful assistance and technical support to States Parties, at their request, and to devise appropriate solutions to overcome the practical difficulties and resource constraints encountered by individual States Parties in carrying out their national implementation measures.   

Mr Chairperson, 

26. 	
Finally, the NAM CWC States Parties and China have noted the initiative of the Director-General to set up an experts panel on the question of future developments in the OPCW under the Convention. NAM CWC States Parties and China look forward to obtaining greater clarity on the Director-Generals proposal in this regard.  We 

encourage the Director-General to ensure an equitable geographical distribution of the panel. The outcome of the panels work could be a useful contribution to the ongoing discussions by the States Parties on the future development of the Organisation, keeping in mind the full implementation of Article 1 of the Convention.   

27. 	
The NAM CWC States Parties and China wish to renew the assurances of their fullest cooperation to you and to all Member States in ensuring the success of this Conference. We would like to request that this statement be issued as an official document of the Fifteenth Session of the Conference of the States Parties.  


I thank you.

OPCW Conference of the States Parties 
Fifteenth Session C-15/NAT.10 29 November  3 December 2010 30 November 2010 ENGLISH only 
KENYA 

STATEMENT BY PROFESSOR RUTHIE C. RONO  
AMBASSADOR AND PERMANENT REPRESENTATIVE OF KENYA  
TO THE OPCW AT THE 
FIFTEENTH SESSION OF THE CONFERENCE OF THE STATES PARTIES 

Mr Chairperson, 
Allow me to take this opportunity on behalf of my delegation to congratulate you on your assumption of the Chair of the Fifteenth Session of the Conference of the State Parties.  I am absolutely confident that, with your immense wealth of experience, you will be able to steer the deliberations of the Fifteenth Session to a successful conclusion.  My delegation will offer you full support throughout the session. 
I would also like to thank the outgoing Chairperson, Ambassador Voidotas Verba of Lithuania, for the exemplary work he did during his tenure at the Fourteenth Session. Equally, I welcome Ambassador Ahmet Üzümcü, who is participating for the first time in his capacity as the Director-General of our Organisation.  Kenya will always offer him steadfast support during his tenure so that the Organisation can fulfil its mandate. 
Mr Chairperson, 
The Kenyan delegation fully aligns itself with the statement made on behalf of the African 
Group by the Permanent Representative of South Africa.  
Kenya notes with satisfaction the progress made towards achieving universality of the 
Convention. We urge those States that are yet to accede to the Convention to do so as a 
matter of urgency. 
Mr Chairperson, 
As you are aware and as this august assembly is, the destruction of chemical weapons is the core issue of the Convention.  Indeed the production and stockpiles of the chemical weapons pose a major threat to world peace and security.  World peace can only be guaranteed when complete destruction of all chemicals is done indiscriminately. The extended deadline of 29 April 2012 as set in the Convention is fast approaching, yet there are clear indications that it may not be met and in particular by the main possessor States.  My delegation would like to implore all possessor States to strive with a view to meeting the extended deadline. We should always be cognizant of the fact that there is no substitute for peace but peace itself. 
CS-2010-6618(E) distributed 03/12/2010 *CS-2010-6618.E* 
I am not however pessimistic, but I feel that there is still optimism if only the possessor States can redouble their efforts, the deadline is within reach and can be met.  From the reports we have received from the major possessor States their destruction processes would require an accelerated approach to beat the extended deadline of 29 April 2012. 
Mr Chairperson, 
As you are aware, Kenya does not possess, produce or have stockpiles of chemical weapons, however the support from the Technical Secretariat in the implementation of the programme for Kenya within the framework of the Africa Programme has continued to infuse the necessary skills and capacity building within the implementation of the Convention which will assist my country in its economic development.  I would like to recognise the efforts of the Technical Secretariat who have in the recent past organised training courses where Kenya participated.  They include basic courses which took place in Ethiopia and South Africa, the chemical safety management course in The Hague, and customs authorities training in Kampala, Uganda, among others.  The Kenya National Authority also played host to an inspection team from the OPCW in January 2010. 
Regarding the domestication of the Convention, the Draft Bill has been prepared and presented to the Cabinet Office for approval before presentation to Parliament for debate and enactment into law. 
Mr Chairperson, 
My Government would like to express its gratitude to the OPCW for assisting the National Authority with GC-MS equipment for the government chemists laboratories which has formally been received.  The equipment will no doubt enhance the functions of chemist laboratories in Kenya including data analysis. 
Mr Chairperson, 
Kenya continues to demonstrate effectively its commitment to the work of this Organisation with up-to-date annual contributions to the OPCW budget.  Equally Kenya continues to be current in its annual declarations having submitted fully in respect to 2009. 
Mr Chairperson, 
The threat of global terrorism continues to be an un-insurmountable challenge which demands our Organisation to step up its efforts in respect to disarmament and prohibition of chemical weapons in line with its mandate.  The threat indeed will be catastrophic in the event that non-States Parties, like Somalia which harbours a large population of pirates in the Indian Ocean, will have access to chemical weapons.  Somalia continues to be a major challenge to the security of world trade and in particular to the security of the region. 
It is therefore imperative that the movement of chemical weapons across the boundaries of member States Parties and non-State Parties alike are monitored closely by a responsive organisation which can effectively deal with chemical incidents on a subregional and regional scale. 
C-15/NAT.10 page 3 
My Government in this regard attaches a lot of importance to the implementation of Article X which provides for assistance and protection to States Parties against chemical weapons attack. I would like therefore to call on our Organisation and States Parties, including other international organisations, to enhance positive collaboration aimed at effective counter-terrorism measures as well as activities geared towards strengthening the capacity of States Parties to respond to chemical incidents. 
Mr Chairperson, 
My delegation, would like to see the full implementation of Article XI through substantial assistance to non-possessor States in order to enable them to develop chemical capacity and industry. This will facilitate the developing countries to view the Convention as a relevant tool to them and as a catalyst for economic development through the unlimited use of friendly chemicals not prohibited in the Convention.  In this respect, my delegation welcomes the development of concrete measures to ensure the promotion of international cooperation in the field of chemical activities through the exchange of scientific and technical information, chemicals and equipment. 
Mr Chairperson, 
I would like to congratulate the Director-General for his good gesture in extending the Programme for Africa for another three (3) years. My country, which is a beneficiary of the programme, looks forward to continued cooperation with the Technical Secretariat in order to strengthen the programme through new initiatives and actions that would strategically contribute directly to capacity building and the transfer of the requisite skills to the African States Parties as well as assist them on the timely implementation of the Convention. 
Mr Chairperson, 
Kenya notes with appreciation the voluntary contributions made by donor States Parties through the Programme for Africa. We also note with appreciation the contributions, including in-kind contributions, which African States Parties continue to make for the implementation of the programme. 
It is my delegations view that the budget for the Programme for Africa should be incorporated and factored into the regular budget of the Organisation so as to have a clear sequence of predictability in its implementation.  Nonetheless, donor funding is a very important component in the implementation of the Programme for Africa. 
Mr Chairperson, 
My delegation is aware of the challenges facing our Organisation and in particular the Technical Secretariat vis-à-vis the geographical balance and equitable representation including gender in the professional ranks of the Organisation.  I would like to implore all the States Parties of our Organisation to support the Technical Secretariat towards implementing a balanced representation, while considering specifically the low representation of the African States Parties which is prevalent in all cadres of our Organisation. 
Mr Chairperson, 
We would like to request that this statement be circulated as an official document of the 
Fifteenth Session of the Conference of the States Parties. 

I thank you.

OPCW Conference of the States Parties 
Fifteenth Session C-15/NAT.11 29 November  3 December 2010 30 November 2010 ENGLISH only 
UNITED KINGDOM 

RESPONSE BY THE UNITED KINGDOM TO A REQUEST FOR CLARIFICATION 
SUBMITTED UNDER ARTICLE IX, PARAGRAPH 2, OF THE CHEMICAL 
WEAPONS CONVENTION 

UK response to compliance concerns 
The United Kingdom values the provisions for consultations, cooperation and fact-finding contained in Article IX as an important element of the Conventions compliance regime. This paper provides clarification to resolve concerns which have been raised about the actions of UK forces in destroying chemical weapons in Iraq.  In the interests of openness and transparency, this paper seeks also to clarify matters which do not relate directly to matters covered by Article IX, but are relevant to UK actions in Iraq at the time. 
The United Kingdom strongly rejects any allegation that it has violated any of its obligations under the Chemical Weapons Convention (the Convention) or undermined the credibility of the Convention. In particular, the United Kingdom absolutely rejects allegations that it has violated its obligations by failing to submit a destruction plan for chemical weapons recovered in Iraq in accordance with paragraph 6 of Part IV(A) of the Verification Annex of the Convention. The United Kingdom has supported the negotiations and implementation of the Convention from the earliest days of the Preparatory Commission, and has continued to provide political, technical and financial support ever since.  The UK is firmly committed to upholding the principles of the Convention. 
The UKs actions to secure and destroy chemical weapons in Iraq were taken in exceptional circumstances and were in full accordance not only with our international obligations, but also with the fundamental object and purpose of the Conventionto rid the world of chemical weaponstaking account of the need to ensure the maintenance of security and stability in Iraq. This was to the benefit of the people of Iraq, the coalition forces, and neighbouring states. If the UK had failed to take such action, chemical weapons could have been acquired and used by insurgents in Iraq. 
The circumstances under which these items were recovered were not envisaged when the Convention was negotiated and agreed by the parties.  This is manifest from the face of the Convention, in that the verification steps it provides would not be practicable in circumstances such as those in Iraq at the time.  (For example, the security situation in Iraq at that time would not have allowed any on-site verification by the Technical Secretariat. Indeed, the security situation in Iraq, although much improved, has still not been such as to 
CS-2010-6625(E) distributed 03/12/2010 *CS-2010-6625.E* 
allow any on-site verification activities by the Technical Secretariat.)  It is precisely because of this type of situation that the Executive Council (at its Fifty-Eighth Session) decided to establish a facilitation to develop guidelines for the security and destruction of chemical weapons in situations not foreseen by the Convention, including conflict situations. Consequently, a number of obligations under, for example, Article IV and Part IV(A) of the Verification Annex of the Convention did not apply in the particular situation in Iraq.  In particular, there was no obligation to submit a destruction plan in accordance with paragraph 6 of Part IV(A) of the Verification Annex.  
After May 2004, the UK was no longer an occupying power.  At the time in question, the Government of Iraq exercised sovereign authority, and the UK was there at their invitation, and under the authorisation of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1546 and subsequent resolutions.  Consequently, the detailed verification and declaration provisions did not apply to the destruction of chemical weapons by UK forces in this particular situation. 
In addition, the UKs actions in destroying the chemical weapons were in fulfilment of our international obligations in light of the mandate provided by the Security Council in Resolution 1546 (2004) (and renewed in subsequent resolutions), which states that the multinational force shall have the authority to take all necessary measures to contribute to the maintenance of security and stability in Iraq.  The letters annexed to Resolution 1546 set out tasks which included the continued search for and securing of weapons that threaten Iraqs security. The timely destruction of the chemical weaponswhich would not have been achievable had the routine verification provisions of the Convention been applicablewas necessary in order to fulfil this mandate. 
Following Iraqs accession to the Convention, with the knowledge of the Iraqi authorities, and in the light of the improving security situation, the UK informed the Secretariat and the Executive Council of the actions it had taken.  This was done in the interests of transparency and the spirit of the Convention.  The UK participated constructively, and in good faith, in the discussions mandated by the Executive Council at its Fifty-Eighth Session on destruction of chemical weapons in situations not foreseen.   
Information on recovery of chemical weapons in Iraq 
None of UNSCOM, UNMOVIC or the ISG were able to confirm that they had destroyed or otherwise accounted for all chemical weapons possessed by Iraq.  It is likely that numbers of chemical weapons had been abandoned, buried or otherwise lost during the course of Iraqs military operations in the 1980s, which were not identified or recovered by UNSCOM or UNMOVIC. (It is not unusual that old chemical weapons munitions are found periodically from former programmes or in combat zones where they were deployed.)  In 2006, UK forces recovered and destroyed 21 such items of suspected chemical weapons believed to have been manufactured by the former Iraqi regime before 1991.  This occurred in two separate operations in January and May 2006. The dangerous operating environment and the constant threat from insurgents at the time meant that troops could only spend a limited amount of time in any one location without inviting attack; all vehicle movement had to be carefully co-ordinated and heavily protected, and no area could be considered safe.  The second destruction operation took place just 24 hours before five UK troops were killed when their Lynx helicopter was shot down by a missile fired by insurgents.  Subsequently, insurgents used chlorine in chemical weapon attacks against Iraqi civilians.  In sum, the destruction of the chemical weapons was conducted in hazardous, complex conditions under constant threat 
C-15/NAT.11 page 3 
of attack. Moreover, these munitions were in a dangerous and corroded condition. Accordingly, the priority was the rapid and safe destruction of the weapons, which were destroyed as quickly as practicable, close to the locations where they were recovered. 
The UK wishes to be as transparent as possible about these operations, both of which took place in the province of Maysaan.  However, because the potential acquisition and use of such weapons by terrorists and insurgent groups poses a continuing threat to the civilian population and the Iraqi Government, as well as to remaining coalition forces, it is not possible to provide further details of the precise locations in Iraq where these items were recovered and destroyed. 

Assessment and destruction of recovered items 
Sixteen 122mm AL BORAK canisters filled with suspected GB agent were released from Iraqi judicial authority to the UK Explosive Ordnance Disposal  (EOD) and Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) teams on 15 January 2006 for destruction. These were confirmed as chemical weapons items by the UK EOD team on the basis of visual identification, and the canisters were immediately leak-seal packaged on-site by UK personnel. They were transported to a nearby secured destruction location and destroyed the next day. 
Five 122mm AL BORAK canisters filled with suspected GB agent were passed to the UK CBRN team on 5 May 2006. Visual identification by the UK team confirmed the items as chemical weapons and they were photographed and leak-seal packaged.  They were transported to a secured destruction location and destroyed later that day. 
The precise quantities of agent were not measured because of the urgent requirement to destroy the weapons quickly and safely, and the corroded and dangerous state of the munitions. 
Other coalition forces were not involved in these two operations. 
In neither case was a chemical weapon storage or destruction facility established. 
Three photographs of the destruction activity on 5 May 2006 are in the Annex (Figures 1, 2 and 3) attached hereto. 

Method of chemical weapons destruction 
Transport and destruction of chemical weapons in Iraq was carried out in such a way as to ensure the safety of people and protect the environment.  In each case, all the canisters were transported to a desert location for immediate destruction by a munitions disposal team.  On arrival, confirmatory vapour checks were carried out to ensure that the canisters and packaging were intact. In both events the destruction method was an explosion in an open area, which was secured, including the downwind locations.  In order to conduct the post-destruction survey, UK personnel returned to the site after each destruction event to confirm that the chemical weapons had been successfully destroyed and that there was no residual contamination on site.  The results showed no chemical weapons or explosive contamination near the demolition crater.  This was confirmed using several types of detector. There was no visual indication of any liquid contamination in the area.  All post-destruction surveys showed that the explosive method used was effective and that no residual threat of contamination remained on-site after this operation.   
All chemical weapons recovered by UK forces in Iraq were completely destroyed. 

Transfer, sampling and analysis 
A small number of samples suspected of containing Schedule 1 chemicals, weighing about 1 gram each, were transferred from Iraq to the UK for confirmatory chemical analysis in order to determine the nature of the safety and security risks they posed.  These were transported in a toxic sample container in accordance with UK national standards to the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory, Porton Down, which is the UKs designated laboratory for analysis of suspected chemical weapons agents.  Analysis showed that the samples contained a mixture of sarin (GB) and GF of varying concentrations.  The samples were destroyed on completion of the analysis. 
No other items were transported to the UK or elsewhere. 

Reporting of information to the Technical Secretariat and the Executive Council 
The decision to destroy these items quickly was taken with safety and security as the key justifications. Although the Secretariat was not advised of these two individual destruction operations at the time, it was made aware of coalition forces operations to recover and destroy chemical weapons in Iraq.  As set out above, there was no obligation to make a declaration, but in the interests of transparency, the UK voluntarily informed the Secretariat by letter of the destruction of these items on 6 April 2009.  The UK letter also requested that this information be distributed to States Parties.  
On 6 April 2009, the UK declared the transfer of samples containing Schedule 1 chemicals under paragraph 6 of Part VI of the Convention Verification Annex, and provided details of the samples and the analytical results. 
In both cases, the UKs actions were driven by security concerns, namely the need to ensure security and stability in Iraq by not releasing information which could have been useful to insurgent groups seeking to acquire and use chemical weapons; at the same time the UK wished to act in accordance with the spirit of the Convention.  In addition, it would not have been appropriate to provide such information without Iraq, as the responsible State, having the opportunity to take part in discussions in the OPCW as a State Party.  Accordingly, in the light of the improved security situation in Iraq, with the agreement of Iraq and after Iraq had become a State Party to the Convention on 12 February 2009, the UK provided the appropriate information and declaration in April 2009.  
The UK also made a short explanatory statement to the Executive Council at its Fifty-Sixth Session on the destruction of the 21 munitions, highlighting that, because of the security conditions in which they were recovered, and in many cases their corroded and dangerous stateand to ensure the safety and security of UK Forces and the Iraqi peopledestruction of the recovered chemical weapons was carried out in as timely a fashion as possible, using explosives. 
C-15/NAT.11 page 5 
The UK subsequently invited the Secretariat to review UK records of chemical weapons destruction activity, and the Secretariat did so in September 2009.  The Secretariat similarly reviewed US records.  The OPCW Director-General, in his report to the Fifty-Eighth Session of the Executive Council stated: In both cases, the Technical Secretariats teams concluded that the documents reviewed during the visit appeared to be consistent with the information provided by the Governments of the United Kingdom and of the United States of America on 6 April 2009 and 17 April 2009 respectively. At the same time, both States Parties demonstrated full transparency and cooperation in providing all required and available information in support of the review. 

Chemical weapons production facilities, equipment and other aspects 
No additional chemical weapons production facilities (CWPF) other than those noted and sealed by UNSCOM were discovered by UK forces.  The UK neither used nor occupied any former CWPFs in Iraq.  Although the UK is aware of reports of looting of specialised equipment, no items were recovered by UK forces.  
No biological weapons were discovered by UK forces in Iraq. 

Conclusion 
The UK has endeavoured to provide sufficient information to resolve the doubts raised, to answer the questions which fall within the purview of Article IX.2, and to provide additional relevant context.

STATEMENT 
TO THE FIFTEENTH SESSION OF  
THE CONFERENCE OF THE STATES PARTIES TO  
THE CHEMICAL WEAPONS CONVENTION 

BY MR MIKE BYERS 
ALTERNATE REPRESENTATIVE OF AUSTRALIA TO THE OPCW  

ON BEHALF OF 

H.E. MS LYDIA MORTON PERMANENT REPRESENTATIVE OF AUSTRALIA TO THE OPCW 


THE HAGUE, 29 November 2010 
Mr Chairman 
Let me join other speakers in congratulating you on your election as Chairman of the fifteenth Conference of the States Parties. 
The Australian delegation looks forward to working with you to help ensure a successful conclusion to this Conference with outcomes supporting the achievement of the objectives of the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC).   
Mr Chairman 
I would also like to extend a very warm welcome to Ambassador Ahmet Üzümcü and to take this opportunity to express my congratulations on his appointment as Director-General of the OPCW.  I am confident that his diplomatic skills, commitment and multilateral disarmament experience will serve the OPCW well in the coming period, to ensure that the Convention will go from strength to strength in achieving a world that is free from the threat of chemical weapons. I pledge the full support of the Australian delegation to assist him in his work. 
Mr Chairman 
The CWC is a cornerstone of the multilateral non-proliferation and disarmament architecture. Countering the threat of chemical weapons demands undiminished commitment to full and effective implementation of the Convention. Australia has long been at the forefront of efforts to counter this threat. 
Mr Chairman 
First and foremost, Australia is encouraged by continuing progress in the destruction of chemical weapons and welcomes the commencement of operations to destroy old chemical weapons abandoned by Japan in China. With less than 40% of declared chemical weapon stockpiles awaiting destruction, we are confident that the remaining CW Possessor States will make every effort to meet their extended deadlines. We do not underestimate this challenge especially given the technical, safety, environmental and financial burden that this entails.    
Australia fully supports the informal consultations led by the Chairman of the Executive Council, Ambassador Jean-François Blarel of France, on issues relating to the final deadlines for chemical weapons destruction.  We believe it prudent for States Parties to be fully prepared for any future situation of unintended non-compliance by CW Possessor States.  We support the Chairmans roadmap approach and are hopeful that suitable remedies and confidence building measures will be found to deal with the projected missed deadline.  My delegation will continue to work with other States Parties to ensure that any agreed approach does not adversely impact on the Convention itself.  
Mr Chairman 
Australia has, from time to time, discovered old chemical weapons (OCW) on its territory and has declared these to the OPCW. I am pleased to advise States Parties that 144 old chemical weapons, discovered and stored at a coal-mining site in Columboola, Queensland, last year, have now been verified as such by the OPCW during the first inspection of its kind in Australia (20-22 September).  
The Australian Government gratefully acknowledges its appreciation to the Government of the United States for its technical assistance to conduct on-site analysis in support of Australias efforts to destroy these unusable munitions, the majority of which contain sulphur mustard. During 2011, a transportable detonation chamber will be imported from the United States, assembled at Columboola and used to safely and completely destroy these OCW, in full accordance with the Conventions requirements. 
Mr Chairman 
Australia supports the Technical Secretariats draft budget for 2011 including its proposed number and distribution of Article VI inspections. As advised by the then Director-General, we note that it may be problematic to sustain the current numbers of Schedule 3 inspections. Australia believes that the inspection levels should be guided by the Technical Secretariats recommendations based on its experience and analysis. 
Australia also strongly supports efforts to enhance the effectiveness of verification of other chemical production facilities or OCPFs especially given the limited numbers of inspections, the relatively vast number of OCPF sites that have yet to be inspected and the increasing relevance of OCPF verification due to advances in science and technology.  We therefore welcome the resumption of the facilitation on the OCPF site selection methodology by Ambassador Pieter de Savornin-Lohman of the Netherlands and Ambassador Fauziah Binti Mohammed Taib of Malaysia, and are willing to engage constructively with them and other States Parties. In this regard, Canada's proposal is worth exploring as a fresh approach to help focus OCPF inspections on sites of greatest relevance to the Convention.  
Mr Chairman 
Apart from its objective of destroying all CW stockpiles, the Convention was established to also prevent States acquiring or developing chemical weapons.  However, the reality of todays global security environment has demonstrated that the threat of the use of chemical weapons or toxic chemicals derives from both State and non-State actors, including terrorists. While no international organisation has the sole responsibility for the prevention of, or response to, chemical terrorism, the OPCW clearly has a central role to play. 
The OPCW, through the actions of both the Technical Secretariat and States Parties, has made, and continues to make, a significant contribution to global anti-terrorism efforts. However, there is a widely held view that there is scope to enhance the OPCWs anti­terrorism efforts.  In this regard, we welcome the fact that the Sixtieth Session of the Executive Council requested the Open-Ended Working Group on Terrorism to examine further the OPCWs contribution to global anti-terrorist efforts, with a view to recommending additional measures as appropriate. We are also strongly encouraged by the collaborative efforts of the Technical Secretariat and States Parties in this regard.  The Working Group has so far held very productive joint meetings with the Facilitations on Article X and Article VII. We hope the Working Group will be able to consider other relevant areas in the near future. 
Australia believes that States Parties can benefit from sharing experiences with each other, as well as with industry and other stakeholders, on measures to strengthen chemical safety and security as a means to reduce the risk of chemical attacks by terrorists and to develop national capacities to respond, in line with the report of the Second Review Conference.  
We therefore welcome recent initiatives on this topic, such as workshops which have been undertaken in various regions including the Asia-Pacific (hosted by Australia), South East Asia and Europe, as well as the conference to be held soon in Africa.  The table-top exercise held last week (22-23 November) in Warsaw, Poland is another case in point.  This exercise, jointly organised by the OPCW and the Government of Poland, addressed the preparedness of States Parties, particularly those in Eastern Europe, to prevent and respond to the use of toxic industrial chemicals in a terrorist attack. We believe that this was a very useful workshop which will provide a model for similar exercises to be organised in other regions. 
We believe that there would be value in sharing the outcomes of both the Warsaw table-top exercise and the African conference with all States Parties through a meeting of the Open­ended Working Group on Terrorism that could be held early next year.  We also support calls for the OPCWs industry outreach activities to be broadened to cover chemical safety and security. Finally, we welcome the Director-Generals plans to organise a special event in 2011 on International Cooperation and Chemical Safety and Security on the occasion of the International Year of Chemistry. 
Mr Chairman 
It is a remarkable achievement that there are presently 188 member countries to the Convention. Only seven countries in the world stand in the way of achieving universality of the Convention, and thereby a complete global CW ban.  We therefore commend the Director-General and States Parties for their continued efforts to ensure that further progress is made, despite the challenges of achieving this ambitious but necessary goal.   
Australia believes that achieving an enduring and effective global CW ban requires not only universality, but also the full and effective implementation of the Convention by its States Parties. We continue to stress the importance of ensuring States Parties make every effort to accelerate the enactment of national legislation or administrative arrangements that cover all key areas of the Convention, and to identify and declare all relevant chemical facilities. Australia will do what it can to assist requesting States Parties to achieve these fundamental Convention requirements.  
Mr Chairman 
When it comes to protection against chemical weapons and response to any incident involving the use of toxic chemicals, assistance and protection can be provided in accordance with Article X.  It is timely, therefore, to thank the Technical Secretariat and the Government of Tunisia for organising and hosting Assistex 3, an international assistance and protection exercise which took place from 11-15 October.  While this was the third major exercise of its kind, it was the first to have also included an investigation of alleged use of chemical weapons. This experience has further highlighted the need for a rapid and well-coordinated response, among multiple stakeholders, to any chemical attack.   
I would also like to congratulate the Technical Secretariat, the Facilitator for Article XI, Mr Chen Kai of China, and sponsoring States Parties for their roles in the preparations and conduct of the workshop on Article XI issues, which was held in The Hague last week (24-25 November).  This workshop was very successful in enabling cooperation and exchange of ideas among States Parties and relevant stakeholders regarding the peaceful uses of chemistry to further the economic and technological development of States Parties.   
Mr Chairman 
In closing, Australia remains steadfastly committed to the object and purpose of the Chemical Weapons Convention. We look forward to further close cooperation with the Technical Secretariat and other States Parties in the coming year so that further progress is made towards achieving strong and effective verification and universal adherence to the Convention. 
Thank you Mr Chairman 




OPCW Conference of the States Parties 
Fifteenth Session C-15/NAT.15 29 November  3 December 2010 29 November 2010 ENGLISH only 
ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF IRAN 

STATEMENT BY H.E. MR MOHAMMAD MAHDI AKHONDZADEH 
DEPUTY FOREIGN MINISTER FOR LEGAL AND INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS  
AT THE FIFTEENTH SESSION OF THE CONFERENCE OF THE STATES  

Mr Chairperson, 
Distinguished Director-General, 
Distinguished delegates, 
Ladies and gentlemen,  
Please allow me to begin by congratulating Your Excellency, the Permanent Representative of the Republic of Guatemala, Mr Julio Roberto Palomo Silva on your well-deserved election as the Chairperson of this important Conference.  I am confident that under your able leadership, this Conference will be steered to a successful conclusion.  I wish you every success. I also wish to express our appreciation to the former Chairperson for his efforts during his tenure to which we owe the success of last years Conference.   
My congratulations also go to Ambassador Ahmet Üzümcü, on his election as the Director-General of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) and wish him every success in turning this prominent Organisation into an excellent example of success among international organisations particularly in the field of disarmament. 
I am deeply honoured to address this august body at the Fifteenth Session of the Conference 
of the States Parties of the Chemical Weapons Convention.    
I also wish to associate my delegation with the policy statement delivered by the 
distinguished Ambassador of Cuba on behalf of NAM CWC States Parties and China.  
Mr Chairperson, 
Recent developments in the international arena mark sea changes in international relations and politics.  Collapse of unilateralism and policies based on military power, as well as coercive diplomacy and arrogant attitude in relations between States by domination-seeking powers and emergence of a new world order and new actors, have paved the way for the discourse of logic, justice, wisdom and human thoughts and culture to prevail. 
It has now become common understanding that the unfair and inefficient global management has come to its end point and that it requires a fundamental reassessment.  Reorganising the 
CS-2010-6633(E) distributed 07/12/2010 *CS-2010-6633.E* 
worlds affairs and ensuring stability and prosperity requires participation of all and a divine management.  The international community can no longer tolerate the logic of force, domination, unilateralism, war and humiliation.  
The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons since its inception has been an exemplary multilateral forum based on the Chemical Weapons Convention, as a unique international instrument in which all States Parties enjoy equal rights.  All the efforts aimed at progress and gradual development of this Organisation are commendable.  
The marathon negotiations, during which the Convention was concluded, were inspired by the horrible memories of the international community of the use of different types of chemical weapons by the Saddam government against both the Iranian civilian population and servicemen.  
The international community is well aware that the active participation of the Islamic Republic of Iran in international negotiations for formulating the Convention was rooted in a very bitter experience in our recent history. 
These all-out inhuman attacks resulted in about 100,000 chemical casualties and martyrs. Just in the case of Sardasht, a small city in northwestern Iran, as a result of deployment of heavy chemical weapons by the Saddam government, large numbers of civilians, including women and children, were chemically killed or wounded.  Deployment of chemical weapons against Sardasht was the first documented large-scale chemical attack against a residential area in the world. 
Major powers, in particular, the United States and a large number of European countries even rewarded Saddam with provision of more advanced military hardware and technologies for production and deployment of different types of chemical weapons.  To ensure that chemical weapons shall not be produced and used ever again, the providers should be exposed to the international community for being held accountable for assisting the Saddam government to commit such heinous crimes. 
Mr Chairperson, 
The recent decision adopted by the Executive Council to annually commemorate the victims of chemical weapons through public statements to be issued by the distinguished Director-General on the anniversary of the chemical tragedy of Sardasht is a positive and praiseworthy step.  The international community is expected to express its sympathy with the victims of chemical weapons and their families thereby healing some of their appalling sufferings. 
It was in the very same context that the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Islamic Republic of Iran, H.E. Mr Manouchehr Mottaki, tabled a proposal on the establishment of an international support network for the victims of chemical weapons at the Eleventh Session of the Conference, which is currently under discussion in the consultations of the Executive Council on Article X of the Convention. 
To further elaborate our views on this issue, a national paper will be circulated to this Conference by my delegation.  I encourage your serious attention to the need for actualisation 
C-15/NAT.15 page 3 
of such an important humanitarian arrangement, which would be a great achievement for the OPCW, enhancing its role and functioning at the international level. 
Mr Chairperson, 
Completion of destruction of chemical weapons stockpiles within the timeline set by the Convention constitutes the raison dêtre of the Convention.  The credibility of the Convention will be in jeopardy if compliance with the final extended deadline is not met.  The recent alarming indications by both major possessor States, namely, the United States and the Russian Federation, that they may not meet the final extended deadline (29 April 2012) to complete the destruction of their chemical weapons stockpiles, has become a source of serious concern. 
The possessor States Parties are genuinely committed to the destruction of their chemical weapons stockpiles within the deadline set by the Convention.  This commitment is not just a theoretical obligation. We urge all possessor States Parties, in particular the United States and the Russian Federation, to comply with their obligations and make every effort necessary to meet the final extended deadline.  
Any breach of the provisions of the Convention will undermine the trust among States Parties and that non-compliance with the cut-off date of destruction can in no way whatsoever be justifiable.   
We are confident that by allocation of required funds, good will and strong determination, the United States and the Russian Federation will be capable of accelerating their destruction operations as appropriate to meet the final extended deadline.  As the saying goes, if there is a will, there is a way.  
Mr Chairperson, 
The invasion of Iraq by the United States and the United Kingdom troops and their allies in March 2003 and occupation of this country was claimed to be for deterring the threat posed to international peace and security by the existing weapons of mass destruction (WMDs). Though, after the occupation of Iraq no information was ever released on the discovery of WMDs in Iraq by the occupying forces, quite surprisingly, in April 2009 (six years later), the United States and the United Kingdom claimed that they had discovered and destroyed some chemical weapons during their invasion of Iraq without informing the OPCW.  
Refraining from declaring the discovered chemical weapons in Iraq and subsequently destroying them, without complying with the provisions set forth in the Convention, on the pretext of being concerned about possible access of terrorist groups to the information or weapons is neither justifiable nor acceptable.  Even safety and security considerations shall not provide any excuse to any country for ignoring its obligations under the Convention. 
The hasty and unilateral actions by the United States and United Kingdom, in contradiction with the Convention, and failure to notify the OPCW and States Parties in accordance with the provisions envisaged in the Convention, raise serious questions and concerns about this issue. Since the unilateral actions by the United States and the United Kingdom have been in violation of the Convention, it requires that the matter be seriously looked into by the OPCW. 
The Islamic Republic of Iran has been seeking clarifications from both countries in accordance with Article IX of the Convention.  However, the answers received are not convincing and even more ambiguity arises surrounding the issue as the concerns persist about the non-compliance that had occurred.  Therefore, after taking into account the answers provided by the United States and the United Kingdom, we will take appropriate measures within the framework of the Convention to address the relevant growing concerns.  The other members of the Coalition of the Willing that are party to the Convention should also be held accountable for their actions. 
Mr Chairperson, 
Given the importance attached to universal adherence to the Convention and its contribution to international peace and security, the Islamic Republic of Iran advocates a new momentum for the OPCW to intensify its efforts in particular by our new Director-General in this area. This is more indispensable to the sensitive region of the Middle East in which the most dangerous case is the Zionist entity with its clandestine programme to develop all kinds of weapons of mass destruction, including chemical weapons.  The international community, particularly powerful States Parties, should exert pressure on the Zionist regime to accede to the Convention without further delay and put its facilities under the OPCW verification regime.  
It is regrettable that as the annual reports released by the OPCW indicate, in the transfer of Schedule 3 as well as Schedule 2 chemicals to non-Parties, large quantities of chemicals of Schedule 2 and Schedule 3 have been transferred to the Zionist regime.  On the other hand, in spite of provisions of Articles VI and XI, some States Parties have put in place certain arbitrary and discriminatory extra-Conventional restrictions on transferring chemicals, equipment and related technologies for peaceful purposes among States Parties whose chemical industries are under constant verification by the OPCW.  Application of such double standards is in violation of the Convention and undermines the integrity and credibility of the Convention. 
In light of implementation of Article XI of the Convention, the Islamic Republic of Iran with its recent technological advances in chemical industry expresses its readiness to engage in the fullest possible exchange of its experiences in chemistry and transfer of chemicals with the States Parties, especially with developing countries. 
In conclusion, may I request that this statement be circulated as an official document of the Fifteenth Session of the Conference of the States Parties. 
Thank you.

OPCW Conference of the States Parties 
Fifteenth Session C-15/NAT.1 29 November  3 December 2010 29 November 2010 ENGLISH only 
IRAN 

THE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF IRANS VIEW AND CONCERN OVER THE 
DISCOVERY AND DESTRUCTION OF CHEMICAL WEAPONS  
BY THE UNITED STATES AND THE UNITED KINGDOM IN IRAQ 

In March 2003 the United States and the United Kingdom and their allies invaded Iraq and consequently occupied the country on the bases of claimed existing WMDs in Iraq and removing the threat posed to international peace and security by these weapons.  However, after the occupation no information was ever released on the discovery of WMDs in Iraq by the occupying forces. 
It was only six years later, in April 2009, that the United States and the United Kingdom informed States Parties that they had discovered chemical weapons after their invasion of Iraq. Most regrettably they acknowledged that they destroyed these chemical weapons without declaring to the Technical Secretariat and submitting destruction plans to and getting approval of the Executive Council of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), despite their obligations to do so under the Chemical Weapons Convention. 
Article III paragraph 1(a)(i) with respect to chemical weapons sets obligations for each State 
Party that: 
Declare whether it owns or possess any chemical weapons, or where 
there are any chemical weapons located in any place under its 

jurisdiction or control; 
Subparagraph (v) of the same article clearly provides that States Parties shall: 
Provide its general plan for destruction of chemical weapons that it owns or possess, or that are located in any place under its jurisdiction or control, in accordance with Part IV (A), paragraph 6, of the Verification Annex; 
The Convention in paragraph 6 of part IV(A) of Verification Annex also sets provisions for 
destruction of chemical weapons in accordance with the order and procedures for their 
stringent verification to be determined by the Executive Council. 
The failure to submit declarations and destruction plan(s) for discovered chemical weapons to the OPCW, in accordance with paragraph 6, Part IV(A) of the Verification Annex of the 
CS-2010-6605(E) distributed 30/11/2010 *CS-2010-6605.E* 
Convention, is a clear violation of the United States and United Kingdom obligations under the Convention. 
Due to the stringent confidentiality regime of the OPCW on handling and protection of information, refraining from declaring the discovery of chemical weapons in Iraq under the pretext of having concern over the possible access of terrorist groups to the information or weapons is unacceptable. Therefore, the real reason for concealment of the discovery of chemical weapons in Iraq, if any, and declaring it after six years, is yet unknown. 
Arbitrary safety and security considerations of the United States and the United Kingdom shall not be used as a pretext for violating their obligations under the Convention while they were operating in Iraq. In such an important issue of chemical weapons destruction, it is only for the Organisation and States Parties to decide. 
The hasty and unilateral actions taken by the United States and United Kingdom to destroy discovered chemical weapons in Iraq without supervision of the Technical Secretariat and Executive Council, in violation of the provisions of the Convention, and their failure to notify the OPCW in accordance to the timelines envisaged in the Convention, raise serious questions about the source and nature of these chemical weapons.  However, should it be the case, since the unilateral action by the United States and United Kingdom undermines the credibility of the Convention, it requires serious consideration of the matter by the OPCW. 
Since the regulations for declaring chemical weapons and their destruction have been clearly and thoroughly envisaged in the Convention in a comprehensive and transparent manner, any argument of destruction of chemical weapons in exceptional circumstances is redundant and unjustifiable. Therefore, under any circumstance, the United States and United Kingdom still had the obligation to declare to the Technical Secretariat and call for a closed session by the Executive Council to decide on the issue according to its rights and powers entrusted to it by the Convention. 
It should be emphasised that informal consultation with the Technical Secretariat staff could not substitute for the obligations of any State Party to declare the chemical weapons it owns or possesses, or falls under its jurisdiction or its control in accordance to Article III. 
The Islamic Republic of Iran has requested clarifications from the United States and the United Kingdom in accordance with Article IX of the Convention and has submitted questions regarding this very issue. The responses provided by the United States and the United Kingdom are still under consideration by the experts in the National Authority of the Islamic Republic of Iran.  Based on our findings from the information that has been provided by the United States and the United Kingdom as well as other information available to the Islamic Republic of Iran, further appropriate measures will be taken in the framework of the Chemical Weapons Convention.  
We strongly believe that if the violation of Convention obligations in such a delicate situation by the two States Parties in question is ignored, it sets a risky and dangerous precedence which would compromise the integrity of the Convention and credibility of the Organisation.

OPCW 	Conference of the States Parties 
Fifteenth Session C-15/NAT.2 29 November  3 December 2010 29 November 2010 ENGLISH only 
IRAN 

PROPOSAL BY THE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF IRAN 
ON THE ESTABLISHMENT OF 
INTERNATIONAL SUPPORT NETWORK FOR THE VICTIMS OF CHEMICAL 
WEAPONS 

Paragraph 11 of Article X of the Convention stipulates assistance to the victims of chemical weapons (hereinafter VCW).  This paragraph gives mandate to the Conference of the States Parties and the Technical Secretariat to allocate adequate resources to meet the needs of VCW.  
The Islamic Republic of Iran in 2003 proposed that an international support network for the VCW be established under the provisions of Article X of the Convention.  This would be an important tool to enable the States Parties facing chemical weapons and a positive step for achieving the objects of Article X as a pillar of the Convention.  The OPCW is the sole competent international body with statutory mandate with regard to chemical weapons and victims of such weapons.  It is expected that the Organisation takes the lead and initiative to become the main communication channel for potential contributors to such network in support for VCW. 
To this end, the delegation of the Islamic Republic of Iran provides possible elements and functions of such network as follows.  It is expected that the Conference of the States Parties gives mandate to the Executive Council and the Director-General to follow up establishing the proposed network at the earliest. 
The role and contributions by the OPCW:  
-	Establishing a data bank on the VCW to include, inter alia, the following: 
o 	Medical needs of the VCW 

o 	Information on offers of the States Parties to the VCW  

o 	Support for the VCW and relevant NGOs to attend the OPCW and other international events to promote the cause of the Chemical Weapons Convention 

o 	Inventory of related national, regional and international, governmental and non-governmental organisations dealing with different aspects of the VCW and facilitating their contacts. 


CS-2010-6606(E) distributed 30/11/2010 	*CS-2010-6606.E* 
-Allocating space on the OPCW website to release information on the VCW including, inter alia, stories, memories, pictures, etc.  
-Coordinating of and acquiring States Parties and other related international assistance for the VCW   
-Establishing and maintaining a voluntary fund to finance provision of assistance to the VCW   
-Allocating adequate resources to medical research on fields needed by the VCW with priority in the context of ICA programmes 
-Convening workshops and seminars aiming to raise awareness on the VCW needs and to promote provision of assistance to them.  
The States Parties contributions:  
-Facilitation of transfer of related materials, equipment and technologies to the States Parties having the VCW 
-Providing the VCW with medical treatments in their own countries in case of the need and non-availability of such services in the homeland 
-Exchange of experiences related to the VCW treatment among the States Parties 
-Providing research scholarships to the developing States Parties in the field of the VCW treatment 
-Encouraging stakeholders and private sectors to provide voluntary assistance to the OPCW voluntary fund on the VCW 
-Promoting awareness about the VCW at the national level in order to draw the attention of the public to contribute to the aims of assisting the VCW.

STATEMENT BY H.E. AMBASSADOR MUHAMMAD ABDULLAH ALHUMAIMIDI 
HEAD OF THE DEPARTMENT OF INTERNATIONAL ORGANISATIONS  
AND COOPERATION IN THE IRAQI MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS 
AT THE FIFTEENTH SESSION OF THE CONFERENCE OF THE STATES PARTIES 

Mr Chairperson, 
Your Excellency, the Director-General of the OPCW, 
Distinguished delegations, ladies and gentlemen, 
I would like to extend my delegations compliments for your election to the chairmanship of the Fifteenth Session of the Conference of the States Parties.  We are of the firm belief that your experience and diplomatic skills will crown our conference with success.  My compliments go also to the Director-General of the OPCW, and to the Ambassador of Lithuania, H.E. Vaidotas Verba, who with great diligence chaired the Fourteenth Session of the Conference of the States Parties last year. 
We associate ourselves with the statement made on behalf of the Group of the Non-Aligned 
Movement and China. 
Mr Chairperson, 
Since the collapse of the former Iraqi regime, the Government of Iraq has committed itself to adopt a number of international steps and actions aimed at non-proliferation, and to get rid of the remaining previous programmes according to the paragraph E of Article 9 of the Iraqi Constitutions (The Iraqi Government shall respect and implement Iraq international obligations regarding the non-proliferation, non-development, non-production, and non-use of nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons, and shall prohibit associated equipment, material, and technologies and delivery systems for use in the development, manufacture, production, and use of such weapons). Therefore my Government supports the international non-proliferation system and is committed to disarmament treaties and other relevant international agreements and arrangements.  
In this context, Iraq supports all the international efforts on fighting nuclear, biological, and 
chemical terrorism and adopting measures to prevent these materials from being in the hands 
of terrorists. 
CS-2010-6624(E) distributed 10/12/2010 *CS-2010-6624.E* 
Mr Chairperson, 
Iraq has been a member of the Convention since February 2009, and submitted its initial declaration of the remaining previous programme regarding bunkers (13 and 41), which were closed by UNSCOM since 1994.  
The Iraqi experts have undertaken discussions and consultations with the Technical Secretariat of the Organisation. Accordingly, the Iraqi Government has formed a national committee to study, evaluate and develop a plan for the destruction of these residues.  This Committee began its work in May 2010 and ended on 22 August 2010.  The Iraqi Government has recently agreed on the Commissions recommendations and established an Advisory Committee consisting of the related Iraqi ministries to follow up on the liquidation of the Al Muthana Bunkers and issuance of the necessary plans for the operations in collaboration with Technical Secretariat of the Organisation (TS). 
Mr Chairperson, 
Proceeding from the Iraqi Governments desire for building confidence and transparency with the international community, invitations were repeatedly extended to the Technical Secretariat to visit Iraq and meet Iraqi officials and experts and visit the sites subject of a declaration, and we are looking forward to have the TS team in Baghdad as soon as possible.  
The Government of Iraq has also taken several steps in the various fields of disarmament and non-proliferation in order to maintain building-confidence, the latest its adherence to The Hague Code of Conduct. 
Iraq has also adopted a number of control measures on the import and export of dual-use material within the framework of the implementation of its obligations under Security Council resolutions relevant to disarmament.  A plan for this purpose had been made with the cooperation of the Ministry of Commerce, Sciences and Technology and the General Authority for Customs.  
Mr Chairperson, 
My Government would like to take this opportunity to express its thanks to the Executive Council and States Parties to the Convention and the Director-General of the Organisation to their response, during the Sixty-Second Session of the Executive Council, on the tragedy of the city of Halabja, by inviting the Director-General, on behalf of the Organisation, to convey annually on 16 March to the authorities and inhabitants of the city of Halabja, a statement in memory of the chemical weapons attacks thereon, and to express sympathy for the victims. 
Finally, we would like to stress the readiness of my Government to cooperate with the Organisation and all States Parties, in order to achieve the noble goals of the Convention on the basis of dialogue and cooperation and the common desire to create a free world of weapons of mass destruction, including nuclear weapons. 
I hope to adopt this statement as an official document of this Conference. 
Thank you.

OPCW Conference of the States Parties 
Fifteenth Session C-15/NAT.5 29 November  3 December 2010 29 November 2010 ENGLISH and SPANISH only 
MEXICO 

STATEMENT BY AMBASSADOR JORGE LOMÓNACO  
PERMANENT REPRESENTATIVE OF MEXICO AT THE  
FIFTEENTH SESSION OF THE CONFERENCE OF THE STATES PARTIES  

Mr Chairperson, 
I wish to express my sincere congratulations on your election as Chairperson of the Fifteenth Session of the Conference of the States Parties and assure you of the support of my delegation. I am certain that your experience and diplomatic skills will lead us to a successful conclusion of this Conference. I also wish to thank your predecessor, Ambassador Vaidotas Verba, Permanent Representative of Lithuania to the OPCW, for his able conduction of the Fourteenth Session of the Conference of the States Parties.  
Furthermore, I wish to recognise the presence of Ambassador Ahmet Üzümcü, in what it is his first participation in the Conference of the States Parties since his appointment as Director-General of the OPCW last year and reiterate to him the full support of Mexico for successful leadership at the helm of the Technical Secretariat. 
Mr Chairperson, 
Mexico is deeply concerned by the fact that, once again, we are confronted with a situation that could undermine the achievements of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons and jeopardise its ability to carry on with its work.  I refer to the lack of agreement on the Programme and Budget for 2011.  As it did happen two years ago, we arrived at the Conference of the States Parties without a decision from the Executive Council and, once more, we are faced with a problem as if it were a choice between principles and pragmatism, choice that we consider a false one. 
Let us be straightforward, we all know that, in fact, the difference of opinions is about two inspections to other chemical production facilities, which represent only 0.02 percent of the Organisations budget. In other words, this is not a budgetary controversy but the expression of a more profound problem: the lack of agreement on a definitive site-selection methodology for OCPF inspections, a decision that has been pending for over 10 years. As we see it, there has been little political will to solve it, which, if it continues like this, could badly reflect on what a credible and successful organisation the OPCW is.  
CS-2010-6611(E) distributed 03/12/2010 *CS-2010-6611.E* 
Mexico strongly believes in the verification system established in the Chemical Weapons Convention and considers it a key instrument for disarmament and non-proliferation.  If, within its regulatory framework, we cannot find solutions to advance these purposes, we run the risk to be stuck for many years in the same problems.  Therefore, Mexico will try to play a constructive role and would try to serve as a bridge to bring closer together the different arguments so as to be able to adopt a decision on the budget for 2011 in this Conference.  But our efforts, Mr Chairperson, should go beyond in order to avoid this recurrent situation.  In this sense, Mexico urges all the delegations to solve the issue of a definitive site-selection methodology for OCPF inspections as soon as possible.  
Mr Chairperson, 
This summer we were informed by one more State Party that it will not be able to conclude the destruction of its chemical weapons stockpiles as set forth in the final extended deadline. This is a cause of serious concern for Mexico, as by now the two main possessor States Parties had notified they only will be able to finish the destruction of 100% of their stockpiles well beyond 2012. Up to date, these are the facts, and although we do not wish this to happen, we, as States Parties, have the responsibility to prepare ourselves to deal with this reality sooner rather than later.  
Mexico considers that the questions as to when and how to discuss this matter have been overcome by the fact that we are already considering it in substance, and although in an initial stage, in the framework of the informal consultations under the leadership of the Chair of the Executive Council. We know this is a forum where decisions are not going to be taken, but these consultations have proven very useful because all delegations have been able to express their ideas, positions, and concerns in an open and transparent manner.  In other words, we are making progress.  
So far, we could conclude there seems to be consensus on the fact that amendments to the Chemical Weapons Convention are not a viable option since it is both impractical and, more certainly, at least for some of us, unacceptable to change the legal framework to adapt it to reality; it is the reality which has to be adapted to the Convention.  For Mexico, the paramount consideration in solving this matter is to safeguard the integrity of the Convention and, therefore, the debate should strengthen it, not debilitate it.   
Mexicos position, once the option of amendments is being set aside, is that we should concentrate our time and efforts on identifying and exploring remedies to the situation.  The Convention does not specify the measures the Executive Council should request the States Parties to take, but allows the Council to consider a list of measures or the possibility of identifying new ones. In this context, we believe we could stick to what the Convention sets out and/or be creative enough to propose other realistic and useful remedies, but always in the existing legal framework.  At the end, we must be clear that whatever decisions are taken, these must be made by the Policy-Making Organs of the OPCW and not anywhere else. 
Notwithstanding all of the above mentioned, we should not forget, not for a single moment, that the destruction of chemical weapons is a standing and unrenounceable obligation and, therefore, the possessor States Parties must complete the destruction of their stockpiles irrespective of the solution we may agree on.

Mr Chairperson, 
We are very close to 2012 and for some time now there has been talk about the need for the OPCW to change its focus from disarmament to non-proliferation.  It is true that some things are going to change after 2012, but in Mexicos opinion, to circumscribe the discussion of the future of the OPCW on this disjunctive it would mean to oversimplify a much more complex reality. 
In contrast, there are issues that need to be addressed urgently, such as the impact that the imminent reduction of destruction activities will bring about on matters like tenure policy, the number of inspectors and the budget.  These are some of the issues that we will face and, therefore, we need to begin discussing them as soon as possible.  Consequently, Mexico supports the establishment of facilitations on these issues and it will participate actively in the discussions. 
Mr Chairperson, 
Mexico participated actively and constructively in the negotiations of the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on Their Destruction, convinced that it would contribute to a general and complete disarmament and to international cooperation in the field of chemical activities for peaceful purposes. That is why Mexico signed the Convention in 1993, ratified it in 1994 and, since its establishment in 1997, has contributed vigorously to the functioning and strengthening of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons.  In the same sense, Mexico is and it will keep strongly committed to the principles and objectives of the Convention and to the work of the OPCW, as they are very useful multilateral instruments promoting international peace and security. 
Thank you. 
I appreciate this statement is issued as an official document of the Fifteenth Session of the Conference of the States Parties.

Delivered on 30.11.2010 

Fifteenth Session of the Conference of the States Parties to the  
Chemical Weapons Convention 

The Hague, 29 November-3 December 2010 


STATEMENT BY THE REPUBLIC OF TURKEY 
(The Fifteenth Conference of the States Parties, 29 November-3 December 2010,  The Hague) 
Mr. Chairman, Mr. Director-General, Distinguished Delegates, Ladies and Gentlemen, 
At the outset, I would like to extend my Delegations compliments to Ambassador Julio Roberto Palomo Silva of Guatemala, for his election to the Chairmanship of the Fifteenth Conference of the States Parties. We are of the firm belief that Ambassador Silvas well respected diplomatic skills coupled with the able guidance of the DirectorGeneral of the OPCW Ambassador Ahmet Üzümcü, will help ensure the success of this conference. They will have the full cooperation and support of the Turkish Delegation. 
Our gratitude goes to the Ambassador of Lithuania, HE Vaidotas Verba, who with great diligence chaired the Fourteenth Conference of the States Parties last year. 
We also extend our thanks and appreciation to Ambassador Jorge Lomonaco Tonda of Mexico and Ambassador Jean-François Blarel of France, the respective Chairpersons of the Executive Council for their diligent and dedicated work. 
Mr. Chairman, 
Turkey has aligned itself with the EU Statement. Nevertheless, I would like to touch upon several issues which are, we believe, important for this body and my country.   
Mr. Chairman, 
The Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) has a noble aim to eliminate entire chemical weapons in a non-discriminatory and verifiable manner. To achieve this aim, universality and full implementation of the obligations under the Convention by all States Parties are essential. 
We are pleased to note that after the accession of Iraq, the Dominican Republic and Bahamas in 2009, the number of States Parties to the Convention have increased to a total of 188. There are 7 States left not party to the Convention. I would like to emphasize that the objective of the Convention will not be fully realized as long as there remains even a single state not party that could possess or acquire chemical weapons. Therefore, we should keep the momentum until all States become party to the Convention. 
Mr. Chairman, 
I would like to touch upon the implementation of one of the core objectives of the CWC, namely the elimination of all chemical weapons and their production facilities. Since the entry into force of the Convention, over 60 % of declared stockpile of 
2 

Category 1 chemical weapons have been destroyed. So far, three States Parties completely eliminated their declared chemical weapons stockpile under the CWC. We welcome the start of the destruction activities of the Abandoned Chemical Weapons by Japan in China. These are important steps towards reaching a chemical weapons free world. 
However, we are concerned that two major possessor states may not be able to meet the final extended deadlines for the destruction of chemical weapons and there is no progress in Iraq to start initial inspection and destruction operations. Taking these facts into consideration, we think that destruction activities will continue after the final extended deadlines. The continuity of the destruction activities after 2012 will have to be maintained, while we preserve the integrity of the Convention. In this context, we support the informal consultations by the Executive Council on issues related to meeting final extended deadlines, with a view to taking a political decision at the next CSP, in 2011. As for the possessor states parties, we expect that they confirm their commitment to continue destruction activities, make every effort to meet their destruction obligations as soon as possible and provide enhanced transparency including a reasonable destruction plan. 
Mr. Chairman, 
Considering the future activities of the OPCW, it can easily be seen that there will be substantial reduction in destruction activities after 29 April 2012. Therefore, the OPCW will need less inspectors and this significant change will cause a reorganization in the OPCW. Although we have more than a year until this change occurs, the Technical Secretariat will soon start preparing the draft programme and budget of the Organisation for 2012, and this draft budget will be discussed after submission to the Executive Council. We are prepared to work with the Technical Secretariat and the Delegations to help the OPCW continue to fulfill its responsibilities in terms of effective implementation of core objectives of the Convention, without any compromises. In this context, we are confident that under the able supervision of the General-Director of the OPCW Ambassador Üzümcü, the Technical Secretariat will successfully realize this transition. 
Mr. Chairman, 
Verification is another core objective of the Convention which provides for systematic on-site monitoring of the destruction of chemical weapons and production facilities. The verification regime also creates an opportunity to monitor the activities not prohibited under the Convention. Taking into account the substantial reduction in destruction activities after 29 April 2012, we need to ensure that the effectiveness of the verification system will be kept. In this vein, we believe that the number of OCPF inspections should further be increased and the declarations of OCPFs should be submitted accurately and updated in a timely manner. We welcome the commencement of consultations on the topic of OCPF Site Selection Methodology under the industry cluster activities and thank the Permanent Representatives of the Netherlands and Malaysia who took up the issue as co-facilitators. My delegation is 
3 

prepared to attend constructively the consultations, in order to develop an agreed methodology in place of the existing interim site selection methodology.  
Mr. Chairman, 
Effective national implementation of the Article VII obligations is crucial for the success of the Convention and plays an indispensable role for our common security. In order to fulfill this obligation, the States Parties should establish a National Authority and take legislative and administrative measures to implement the Convention. Turkey acknowledges the progress made on the implementation of Article VII obligations, however it is clear that further efforts are required worldwide in this field.  
Mr. Chairman, 
Assistance and protection against chemical weapons continues to be an equally important topic.  It is crucial to give an effective and timely response in case of use or threat of use of chemical weapons. In this context, I would like to inform the Conference that Turkey participated with a medical team in the third exercise on delivery of assistance, ASSISTEX 3, which was held from 11 to 15 October 2010, in Tunisia. This exercise gave the opportunity to evaluate the preparedness of the Technical Secretariat and States Parties to deliver assistance under Article X of the Convention. We believe that ASSISTEX 3 will contribute to the better implementation of this article. 
Turkey attaches particular importance to Article XI of the Convention which is economic and technological development. International cooperation in this field avails States Parties to develop capacities required to implement the Convention and promote use of chemicals for peaceful purposes. In this regard, we were pleased to participate in the workshop, which took place at the OPCW Headquarters on 24 and 25 November 2010 on exploring concrete measures to improve the implementation of Article XI of the CWC. During the workshop, it was possible to take stock of implementation of international cooperation activities in this field and develop new ideas and concrete measures for full implementation of Article XI of the Convention. 
Mr. Chairman, 
The Delegation of Turkey looks forward to working with you and with the Secretariat constructively in the coming days and pledges its full support for the successful completion of the Conference. 
Thank you.

STATEMENT  
by H.E. Mr. Oleksandr Horin, 
 Head of Delegation, Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs of Ukraine 
at the Fifteenth Session of the Conference of States Parties  
to the Chemical Weapons Convention 
The Hague, 29 November 2010 

Mr. Chairman, 
First of all I would like to join previous speakers in extending my warmest congratulations to you upon your assumption of the Chairmanship of the Conference. We are convinced, that your skills will allow you to steer successfully the work of the Fifteenth Session of the Conference. In performing your important duties you may completely rely on full support and co-operation of the delegation of Ukraine. 
I would also like to thank the former Chairman of the Conference, Ambassador Vaidotas Verba of Lithuania for his role and contribution to the success of the previous Fourteenth Session of the Conference. 
It is also a great pleasure for us to extend our greetings of welcome to the OPCW Director-General Ambassador Ahmet Uzumcu and express gratitude to him and his staff for their continuous efforts in ensuring progress in the implementation of the Convention. 
The delegation of Ukraine aligns itself with the Statement delivered by Belgium on behalf of the European Union. 

Mr. Chairman, 
Universality of the CWC is an important factor to enhance its credibility and ensure irreversible character of chemical disarmament in global dimension. The OPCW Member States already represent about 98% of the global population and landmass, as well as 98% of the worldwide chemical industry.  
Ukraine highly appreciates the efforts undertaken by the OPCW and the States Parties to ensure universality of the Convention. Nevertheless, Ukraine expects that other states, which still remain outside the Convention, would follow suit sooner rather than later. 
We believe that an active pace towards the universality of the Convention has to be resumed.  

Mr. Chairman, 
Since both chemical industry and science play a growing role in modern society, proper implementation of the Convention by its State Parties on the national level is of critical importance for its viability. We are pleased to note that implementation of basic obligations stemming from Article VII of the CWC is 
2 

being actively pursued. Ukraine, therefore, stands ready to endorse further recommendations to the Conference in this regard.   
Ukraine has always displayed utmost responsibility in implementation of its obligations under the international treaties. The unconditional compliance with the CWC remains in the priority list of arms control, disarmament and non­proliferation policy of Ukraine. 
Having enacted the appropriate legislation, we continue to enforce respective national implementation acts, including those pertaining to Ukraines membership in the Australia Group. 

Mr. Chairman, 
Chemical disarmament remains the priority issue for the OPCW and the State Parties. We attach particular importance to the timely destruction of chemical weapons stockpiles, accumulated by the possessor states. In this context, we share the view that CW destruction have to be implemented as rapidly as practicable and in strict compliance with the highest environmental requirements. We welcome efforts of possessor states to examine available measures that might accelerate further CW destruction. 
In this regard, we welcome the report of the Executive Council delegation visited last September, upon the invitation of the Government of the Russian Federation, the chemical weapons destruction facility in Pochep, Bryansky Region. Ukraine commends renewed firm commitment of the Russian Federation for fulfilling its obligations under the Convention, including  the complete destruction of its remaining stockpiles.   
The Verification regime of the OPCW is a crucial element of multilateral control over destruction of chemical weapons, as well as the tool to deter chemical proliferation. Ukraine supports current OPCW activities. The issue of ensuring a viable chemical non-proliferation regime should be given proper attention in the future. 
We are in favour of a more equitable and fair methodology in the selection of inspections for the other chemicals production facilities (OCPF), which should focus on inspections of the facilities posing greater risks and diminish the burden of inspection for the countries which possess a relatively small number of OCPF on their territory. 

Mr. Chairman, 
Ensuring the implementation of Article X of the CWC remains one of the most important tasks for the OPCW and its Members. In this context the National Authority of Ukraine continues consultations with the OPCW Technical Secretariat aimed at concluding bilateral agreement on assistance measures chosen by member states under Article X of the Convention. The last consultations were held in Kyiv in November 2010. 
3 

We are pleased to inform you that Ukraine was among several State Parties, which hosted during 2009-2010 a few visits of experts from the TS OPCW, aimed at assessing the readiness and reliability of the technical means and human resources offered by Ukraine under Article X. Without prejudice to the conclusions made by the expert team, Ukraine is pleased that our Ministry of Emergency, Ministry of Defense and the Ministry of Health succeeded in demonstrating the good skills of their personnel and the readiness of special tools and equipment for rescue and emergency missions involving chemical agents. 
Two Ukrainian experts were nominated by the National Authority of Ukraine to participate as competent observers in the Third OPCW Exercise on the Delivery of Assistance (ASSISTEX 3), Tunis, Tunisia, 11-15 October 2010 which increased the best practice of the ASSISTEX-2 multilateral exercises, held in Ukraine in 2005. 
It is also important to continue the work aimed at facilitation of Article X in order to identify further areas and activities to address the concerns of Member States in the sphere of protection against threat of use of toxic chemicals as a means of terror. A concrete example in this direction is the proposal tabled by Poland to conduct a Table Top exercise supported by EU to reduce the risks of toxic chemicals being acquired or used for terrorist purposes.  

Mr. Chairman, 
Activities of the OPCW are based on an efficient budgetary system and we appreciate efforts of the Technical Secretariat to improve the effectiveness of cost management and measures to reduce some spending. Planned zero budget increase for six consecutive years which is not expected to hamper effective functioning of the OPCW is a very important achievement of the OPCW. 
In this respect, strong budgetary possibilities will make OPCW more functional and resourceful for the implementation of its ultimate goal.  The Ukrainian delegation, therefore, expects that the Session will support the recommendations of the Executive Council as to its future budget with due consideration of the needs and interests of both the OPCW as a whole and individual States Parties. 

Mr. Chairman, 
Finally a few words about the role of chemical science and technology, which continues to play a prominent role in the 21st century. This is confirmed by the announcement in 2011 - the Year of Chemistry according to the decision of UN Assembly. 
In our opinion, the activities in the area makes an invaluable contribution in shaping the future of our Organization, as evidenced by the preliminary evaluation of the Workshop on Article XI of the Chemical Weapons Convention. We hope that these results will be carefully handled and we will have opportunity to be familiar with the recommendations regarding the OPCW future.

Mr. Chairman, 
At this Session of the Conference we are addressing issues that demand our close attention. The delegation of Ukraine is ready to co-operate fully with the delegations of other States Parties and the OPCW Secretariat to do its utmost to work for the implementation of the important task of the Organization aimed at complete elimination of chemical weapons.  
Thank you for attention.
