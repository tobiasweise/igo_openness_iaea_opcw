1993;In April 1993, the Standing Advisory Group on Safeguards Implementation (SAGSI), acting on a request by the Director General, reported its recommendations for a strengthened and more cost effective safeguards system to the Director General. These recommendations focused on a safeguards system characterized by greater transparency and openness (i.e. broader inspector access) and by the implementation of new technical measures designed to enhance the Agency's ability to provide assurances regarding the absence of undeclared nuclear activities in States with comprehensive safeguards agreements. SAGSI further indicated that these measures, in conjunction with an increased level of co-operation with State Systems of Accounting and Control (SSACs), could lead to greater efficiency with respect to the traditional material accountancy system Back;SG
1995;It was therefore recommended that efforts be made to present the results from comparative assessment studies in a more transparent manner so they can be used more readily in decision making processes and communicated to the media and the public. Back;ADM
1997;The OSART guidelines covering operations, maintenance, management, organization and administration, training and technical support were reviewed. Other developments in this programme included the participation of representatives of the plant and the host countryÃ­s regulator in OSART team training. This has been very well received by the host countries as a way of widening knowledge of the review methodology and promoting the transparency of missions. ;INSTR
1997;A comprehensive review of the AgencyÃ­s recruitment process was completed. The aims of the review were to increase the number of candidates from the target groups established by the General Conference Ã³ women and developing, under-represented and nonrepresented Member States Ã³ as well as to increase the transparency and objectivity of the selection process. Back;ADM
1997;As of December 1997, a total of 955 reports had been received by the Agency. Information from all these sources contributes to much greater knowledge and transparency about the nuclear programmes of States. ;INSTR
1998;The OSART report, sent to the government and the regulatory body, also promotes openness and transparency. Back;INSTR
1998;A technical document on the application of quality assurance/quality management within regulatory bodies was completed. The document provides information for developing systematic approaches to quality within regulatory bodies and contributes to promoting transparency in the performance of regulatory activities Back;INSTR
1998;Though many technical aspects were discussed and various recommendations made, attention was also paid to the Ã«softerÃ­ aspects of safety. For example, there was great interest in the effectiveness of safety management and the role of safety culture, transparency in decision making and the criteria used, and the effectiveness of the regulator;INSTR
2000;These included a number of practical steps for non-proliferation, nuclear disarmament, safeguards and export controls, peaceful nuclear co-operation, universal adherence to the treaty, and further strengthening of the review process. Moreover, the Conference agreed that there should be more transparency on the part of the nuclear weapon States with regard to their capabilities, as well as a diminishing role for nuclear weapons in security policies. ;INSTR
2000;"The ìoutcomesî referred to above are central to the results based approach and concentrate on the responses to stated problems that a given Agency programme is expected to bring about in Member States. Performance indicators are derived against which the effectiveness of the programme can subsequently be judged. The advantages of this approach include: increased transparency; greater participation of Member States in programming, leading to better identification of their needs; better priority setting; and improved evaluation of performance. Back";ADM
2001;Public demands for reassurance on safety issues, with calls for greater transparency and accountability, are being widely voiced in many countries. The need, therefore, for a more effective and transparent international safety regime continues to be a high priorit Back;ADM
2001;Developed principally for developing Member States, SIMPACTS allows decision makers to make reasonable estimates of environmental impacts and costs using a minimum amount of input data. The analysis is simple, transparent and user friendly. While not intended as a replacement for a detailed environmental impact assessment, SIMPACTS is capable of producing results that are similar to those obtained through such methods. ;INSTR
2002;The 2002 missions to Brazil and the United Kingdom, and the forthcoming missions to France, Japan, Panama and Turkey represent a significant development. In particular, France, Japan and the United Kingdom are major shippers of radioactive material, while Panama and Turkey control important waterways for international maritime transport. The publication of the full mission reports is also a significant step towards greater transparency with regard to the Back;ADM
2002;The discussions concluded that a credible, systematic, international approach to the protection of the environment is needed to meet the commitments of Member States. Moreover, this mechanism should be transparent, flexible, and consistent with the approaches applied to other environmental stressors and with the principles for the radiological protection of humans.

2004;The conference noted that greater openness and objectivity were also needed in communications with the public and decision makers Back;ADM
2005;The findings and conclusions of the meeting referred to the need for openness and transparency in the nuclear industry, the necessity for both regulators and operators to show leadership in nuclear safety, the importance of knowledge management as experienced staff retire and facilities move into extended operation, and the requirement to avoid complacency resulting from good safety performance in the recent past Back;INSTR
2005;"The aims of the PCMF are to: ï Help Member States take responsibility for the design and execution of the programme; ï Capitalize on the teamwork and participation of all stakeholders from the outset; ï Promote greater transparency and consistent application of good business practices Back";INSTR
2006;To increase transparency, seek eff ective solutions and permit the participation of interested parties, the Agency in 2006 formed an International Steering Commiee on Denials of Shipments of Radioactive Material. The commieeís mandate is to coordinate international efforts at determining solutions to issues related to the denial of shipments and to facilitate the coordination of a comprehensive international work plan of activities. Back;ADM
2006;For the first time, the technical cooperation programme was designed using the PCMF, a new approach to managing the programme supported by a web based platform. The screening and design of projects was accomplished in a transparent and interactive manner, with Member States made aware of the details of their national programmes that would be discussed with the Secretariat at the time of the General Conference. ;ADM
